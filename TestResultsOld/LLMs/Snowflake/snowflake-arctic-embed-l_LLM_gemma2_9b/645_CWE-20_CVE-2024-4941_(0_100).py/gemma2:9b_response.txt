Based on the provided code changes and commit message, it seems likely that this is addressing a vulnerability, possibly one of those listed (CVE-2024-4941, CVE-2024-1561, or CVE-2024-0964).  

**However:** Without more context like the full commit message, the specific security advisory, or details on how these changes mitigate the vulnerability, it's impossible to definitively say which CVE ID is being addressed. 


**Here's what we can infer from the code changes:**

* **Focus on Security:** The changes are concentrated in areas related to thread management (`prevent_thread_lock`, `time.sleep`), caching (`LRUCache`), and potentially sensitive API interactions (`private space`).
* **Potential for Race Conditions/Timing Attacks:** The added time delays and cache implementation might be aimed at preventing race conditions or timing attacks that could exploit vulnerabilities in the original code.


**To get a definitive answer, you would need to:**

1. **Check the full commit message:** It often provides more context about the issue being fixed and the CVE ID (if applicable).
2. **Search for related security advisories:**  Gradio likely has a public advisory system or blog posts detailing patched vulnerabilities.
