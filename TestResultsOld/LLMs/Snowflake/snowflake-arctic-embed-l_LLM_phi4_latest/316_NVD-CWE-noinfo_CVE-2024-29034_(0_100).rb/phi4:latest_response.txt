The provided context does not mention "CVE-2024-29034" but includes information about two specific CVEs: "CVE-2024-28103" and "CVE-2024-0795." Below is the relevant information extracted for these CVEs:

### CVE-2024-28103

**Summary:**  
This vulnerability relates to a permissions issue where an admin role could potentially allow users with non-admin roles to elevate their permissions. 

**Details:**  
- **File Affected:** `index.jsx`
- **Mitigation Changes:**
  - Introduced a mapping (`ModMap`) that restricts modification capabilities based on the current user's role.
  - Ensured only certain roles can modify or delete other users, preventing unauthorized permission changes.

### CVE-2024-0795

**Summary:**  
This vulnerability involves an issue where updates to admin roles could lead to a scenario with no system admins remaining, which could compromise administrative functionality.

**Details:**
- **File Affected:** `index.js`
- **Mitigation Changes:**
  - Implemented a check (`ModMap`) ensuring at least one admin remains after role changes.
  - Added validations that count current admins before allowing any role change to non-admin for existing admins.

Both CVEs involve modifications in JavaScript files related to user roles and permissions, focusing on preventing unauthorized privilege escalation and maintaining administrative control.
