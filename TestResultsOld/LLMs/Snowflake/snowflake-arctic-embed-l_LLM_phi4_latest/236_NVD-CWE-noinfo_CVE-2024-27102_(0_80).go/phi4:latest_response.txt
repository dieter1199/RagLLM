To determine if any of the provided CVEs relate to the given Go code snippet, let's analyze each context:

1. **CVE-2022-48682**: This vulnerability concerns a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the `remove()` function within C code, where files are deleted without verifying that they haven't been replaced by an attacker. The Go code snippet deals with file operations using the `os` package and does not involve direct manipulation of file deletions or any explicit checks to prevent TOCTOU attacks. Therefore, this CVE is not applicable.

2. **CVE-2019-25211**: This vulnerability pertains to a wildcard parsing issue in the Gin-Gonic CORS middleware, specifically regarding origin strings in HTTP requests. The Go code snippet does not involve CORS configuration or handle HTTP request origins. Thus, this CVE is unrelated.

3. **CVE-2024-2221**: This vulnerability involves path traversal and arbitrary file upload through a specific endpoint in Qdrant, a Rust-based application. The Go code snippet does not implement any web server endpoints, nor does it perform file uploads or handle requests that could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. Therefore, this CVE is also irrelevant.

After reviewing the provided contexts and comparing them with the Go code snippet, none of the described vulnerabilities are applicable. The code primarily handles package imports and file operations without engaging in behaviors related to any of the mentioned CVEs.

**Conclusion**: No vulnerability was found in the provided Go code snippet based on the given contexts.
