The provided contexts indicate three different CVE IDs with their corresponding vulnerabilities and mitigations:

1. **CVE-2024-33883**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability pertains to the use of `window.open` without a specific target, allowing attackers to open new windows or tabs that can lead to phishing attacks.
   - **Mitigation**: The mitigation involves replacing `window.open` with a secure method named `safeWindowOpen`, which ensures that all links are opened in a secure context.
   - **Files Affected**: Changes were made in files like `sponsored.ts` and `webApp.ts`.

2. **CVE-2024-33905**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability involves the use of the unsafe `setInterval` function with untrusted input, which could lead to potential security issues such as unauthorized resource access or DoS attacks.
   - **Mitigation**: The mitigation includes creating a custom wrapper for `setInterval` that incorporates strict validation checks on interval values before using them.
   - **Files Affected**: Changes were made in files like `index.ts`, `requestHelper.ts`, and potentially others.

3. **CVE-2024-0436**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability is related to a timing attack exploiting the linear comparison (`!==`) used for password checking, allowing an attacker to brute-force passwords.
   - **Mitigation**: The mitigation changes involve replacing the linear comparison with an `O(1)` check using bcrypt hashing and comparison functions.
   - **Files Affected**: Changes were made in files like `index.jsx` and `validatedRequest.js`.

Based on this context, all three CVE IDs are associated with specific vulnerabilities that have been addressed through code modifications as detailed above. Each CVE ID has a distinct issue and corresponding mitigation strategy. If the task is to identify which vulnerability was found based on these contexts, all three were identified and mitigated in their respective scenarios.
