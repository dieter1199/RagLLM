Based on the provided information, we can identify three different CVEs with their associated changes:

1. **CVE-2024-39903:**
   - This CVE pertains to an issue where `os.path.getatime()` would follow symlinks when called on a symlink pointing to a directory. The mitigation involved checking if the path is a symbolic link before accessing it, thus preventing symlink following and potential unauthorized access.
   - Changes included modifications in files such as `pathlib.py` and `os.py`, with specific lines added to prevent symlink resolution.

2. **CVE-2024-4030:**
   - This vulnerability was related to the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class dereferencing symlinks during cleanup, which could allow users to modify permissions of files referenced by symlinks.
   - The fix involved creating a function `_dont_follow_symlinks()` that ensured symlink following was disabled unless necessary. Changes were made in `tempfile.py`, with lines added and removed to implement this behavior.

3. **CVE-2024-39903:**
   - This CVE involves the handling of symbolic links by `os.path.getatime()`, where it improperly followed symlinks when called on directories. The fix included changes to prevent following these links.
   - Specific changes were made in files like `pathlib.py` and `os.py`.

Each CVE addresses a distinct issue related to symlink handling, with specific code modifications applied to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

In summary, all three CVEs—CVE-2024-39903, CVE-2024-4030, and CVE-2023-6597—were found in the context provided, each addressing different aspects of symlink security in Python's standard library.
