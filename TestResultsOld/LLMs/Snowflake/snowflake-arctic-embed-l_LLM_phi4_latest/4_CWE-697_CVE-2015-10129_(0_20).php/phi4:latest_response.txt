No specific CVE ID "CVE-2024-21517" is mentioned in the provided context. However, there are references to two other CVE IDs:

1. **CVE-2024-2417**: This vulnerability involves FusionPBX before version 5.2.0 not validating a session properly. The changes made to address this issue include modifications to validate the session by hashing and comparing values from `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` and `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']`. These changes are found in files `authentication.php` and `check_auth.php`.

2. **CVE-2024-24539**: This vulnerability also concerns FusionPBX but specifically involves issues with session validation prior to version 5.2.0. The mitigation involves ensuring that a user's session is properly validated by checking the hashed values of session data against expected values derived from server variables. Changes related to this were made in the same files: `authentication.php` and `check_auth.php`.

Based on the context provided, these two CVE IDs are relevant to the issues addressed through code modifications for session validation in FusionPBX.
