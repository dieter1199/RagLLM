The relevant CVE IDs provided are:

1. **CVE-2024-35242**: This vulnerability is associated with the Silverstripe framework. A bad actor could exploit a server-side sanitisation flaw to inject JavaScript or HTML payloads into the front end of a website by manipulating content in the CMS. The attack vector involves encoded payloads that bypass client-side sanitisation but are not caught by server-side checks until version 5.2.16. The solution is to upgrade to this or a later version, as there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

2. **CVE-2024-32981**: This is another Silverstripe framework vulnerability where an attacker with CMS access could inject JavaScript payloads using specially crafted encoded data attributes. Server-side sanitisation was insufficient until it was updated in version 5.2.16 to handle such cases, specifically by blocking `data:text/html` attributes. The mitigation involves upgrading to the secure version or later.

Both CVE-2024-35242 and CVE-2024-32981 are related to Silverstripe and involve server-side sanitisation issues leading to potential JavaScript injections. No information is provided about a CVE with the ID **CVE-2024-24821**, hence it is not considered in this context. 

In summary, for both CVEs (35242 and 32981) associated with Silverstripe, users are advised to upgrade their systems to version 5.2.16 or later to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
