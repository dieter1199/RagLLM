The provided code snippets involve modifications aimed at mitigating security vulnerabilities associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Let's analyze the context to identify the relevant information:

### Retrieved Context: CVE-2024-23645

**Related Information about CVE-2024-23645:**
- **Vulnerability Type:** XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- **Affected Component:** GLPI
- **Summary:** This vulnerability affects multiple files in the GLPI project where input is echoed back to users without proper sanitization. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed on user browsers, leading to potential data theft or session hijacking.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access and execution of arbitrary code within a victim's browser, potentially compromising sensitive data.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
  - Use `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize output before rendering it in HTML contexts.
  - Ensure that all input is properly validated and sanitized before use.

**Code Changes Reflecting Mitigations for CVE-2024-23645:**
1. In the provided code snippet, several lines show the introduction of `htmlspecialchars()` when echoing variables such as `$_GET['itemtype']` to prevent XSS.
2. Additional logic was introduced in various places to validate and sanitize user inputs (e.g., casting to integers for numerical values, validating date formats).

The changes align with typical mitigations for XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring that any data coming from users is properly sanitized before being used or displayed.

### Conclusion:
The provided context and code modifications correspond to the mitigation of CVE-2024-23645. The focus on preventing script injection via input sanitization directly addresses the concerns outlined in this vulnerability's description. No mention of other vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2024-31456) is present, indicating that the relevant information pertains specifically to CVE-2024-23645.
