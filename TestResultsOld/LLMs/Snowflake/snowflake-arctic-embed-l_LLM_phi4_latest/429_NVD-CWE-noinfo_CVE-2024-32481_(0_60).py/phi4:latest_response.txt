The retrieved contexts provided relate to three different CVEs: CVE-2024-5642, CVE-2024-21503, and CVE-2024-34078. Here's a summary of the vulnerabilities and their associated changes:

1. **CVE-2024-5642**: This vulnerability pertains to improper use of `wsgi.input` in WSGI servers, which could allow an attacker to manipulate input in a way that might bypass security checks or trigger unwanted behavior. The mitigation involved ensuring that `wsgi.input` is not closed until the request finishes and making sure input is read correctly by replacing instances where `self.bytes_read` was used with proper reading mechanisms.

2. **CVE-2024-21503**: This vulnerability affected the `black` code formatter, specifically in its handling of leading tabs when `keep_typographic_whitespace=False`. The issue allowed specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization due to unicode normalization happening too late. The fix involved normalizing unicode earlier in the processing pipeline.

3. **CVE-2024-34078**: This vulnerability was present in the `html-sanitizer` library, where certain Unicode characters could normalize into chevrons, potentially allowing HTML escaping of sanitation. The mitigation was achieved by adjusting when normalization occurred within the sanitization process to prevent such escapes.
