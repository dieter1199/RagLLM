To determine which of the provided CVE IDs is relevant to the given code context, we need to analyze the changes described in each section and see if they correspond with any known issues associated with these CVEs.

1. **CVE-2024-24758**: This CVE pertains to an issue where sensitive information might be exposed due to misconfigurations or improper handling of data within a system's codebase. The context provided does not mention anything about data exposure, privacy concerns, or security flaws related to handling sensitive information.

2. **CVE-2024-28849**: This CVE relates to the improper handling of headers in HTTP requests and responses, particularly concerning the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. The description includes changes made to the way origins are handled, which is a direct match with what's described in the code context: "Ensures that requests from trusted origins are allowed by setting appropriate CORS headers."

3. **CVE-2024-0795**: This CVE involves an authorization issue where users could potentially escalate their privileges or perform unauthorized actions due to improper access control checks. The code context provided discusses changes related to role management and permission checks, but it specifically addresses ensuring that admin roles are preserved and proper access controls are in place rather than a vulnerability being exploited.

Based on the analysis:

- **CVE-2024-24758** does not match because there is no mention of sensitive information exposure.
- **CVE-2024-0795** involves authorization issues, but the changes described focus on maintaining admin presence and proper role checks rather than exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2024-28849** directly matches the context provided regarding CORS header handling.

Therefore, the relevant CVE ID for this code context is **CVE-2024-28849**, related to improper handling of CORS headers.
