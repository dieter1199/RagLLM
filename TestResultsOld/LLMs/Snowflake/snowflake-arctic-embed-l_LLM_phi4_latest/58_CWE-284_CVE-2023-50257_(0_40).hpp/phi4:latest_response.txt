To determine which CVE is relevant to the changes made in the provided code files, we need to analyze the context of the updates:

1. **TCPDF Version Update**: The version number in `tcpdf_static.php` has been updated from 6.6.2 to 6.7.4. This indicates a new release that likely addresses vulnerabilities present in earlier versions.

2. **File Changes**:
   - In `tcpdf_static.php`, the update includes changes to how arrays are returned, suggesting improvements in handling data safely.
   - In `tcpdf_static.php` and `tcpdf_fonts.php`, there are modifications related to function calls and return types, which could be aimed at preventing security issues like code injection or improper data handling.

3. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:
   - The changes suggest a focus on fixing vulnerabilities related to insecure data handling or execution paths.
   - Given the nature of PDF libraries, common vulnerabilities include code execution through malicious input or improper resource management.

4. **CVE Analysis**:
   - **CVE-2024-30258**: This CVE would likely be relevant if it pertains to a vulnerability in TCPDF versions prior to 6.7.4 that involves insecure handling of functions or data.
   - **CVE-2023-50257**: If this CVE was identified before the release of version 6.7.4 and involved similar issues, it could also be relevant.
   - **CVE-2024-32489**: This would be applicable if it is a newer vulnerability discovered after the release of version 6.7.4.

Based on the information provided:

- The update from version 6.6.2 to 6.7.4, along with changes in handling data and function calls, suggests that **CVE-2024-30258** or **CVE-2023-50257** are likely addressed by this release. Since the version number increased significantly (from 6.6.2 to 6.7.4), it is reasonable to infer that a more recent vulnerability, such as CVE-2024-30258, was patched.

Therefore, the retrieved CVE ID related to these changes is likely **CVE-2024-30258**. This conclusion is based on the timing of the version update and the nature of the code modifications aimed at improving security.
