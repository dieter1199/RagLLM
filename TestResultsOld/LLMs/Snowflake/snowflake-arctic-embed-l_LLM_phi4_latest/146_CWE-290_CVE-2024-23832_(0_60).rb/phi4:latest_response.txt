The provided contexts describe changes made to address specific vulnerabilities in software:

1. **Context 1:**
   - **CVE ID:** No direct CVE ID is mentioned for this context.
   - **Description:** The context discusses a vulnerability related to authorization checks when updating user information. Specifically, it addresses the risk of an admin being able to overwrite their own information with another user's details due to insufficient authorization logic.
   - **Mitigation Changes:**
     - Added code to verify that `ctx.state.user.id` matches `data.id` before performing updates.
     - Deleted lines of code that allowed updates without this verification.

2. **Context 2:**
   - **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1738
   - **Description:** This vulnerability involves incorrect authorization allowing users to retrieve evaluation results from any organization by knowing the evaluation ID, due to missing project ID verification.
   - **Mitigation Changes:**
     - Added a condition in the SQL query to check `e.project_id = ${projectId}` to ensure proper authorization.

3. **Context 3:**
   - **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0436
   - **Description:** This vulnerability involves a timing attack on password protection due to the use of linear comparison (`!==`), which can be exploited to brute-force passwords.
   - **Mitigation Changes:**
     - Changed password verification logic from using `!==` to using `bcrypt.compareSync`, providing constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.

Based on these contexts, CVE-2024-1738 and CVE-2024-0436 are directly associated with the described vulnerabilities and their mitigations. The first context does not have an explicit CVE ID but describes a similar type of authorization issue that could potentially be linked to a vulnerability like those in CVE-2024-1738 or another hypothetical CVE.

In summary:
- **CVE-2024-1738** is related to incorrect authorization in accessing evaluation results.
- **CVE-2024-0436** addresses timing attacks on password verification.
- The first context describes an authorization issue without a specific CVE ID.
