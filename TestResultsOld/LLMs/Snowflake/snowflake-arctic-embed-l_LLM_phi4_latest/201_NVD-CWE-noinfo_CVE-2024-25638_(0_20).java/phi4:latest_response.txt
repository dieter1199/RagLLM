### Analysis of Provided Context

The provided context includes information about three different CVEs:

1. **CVE-2024-25638**:
   - **Description**: The issue involves improper encoding or validation of content in DNS zone files in BIND before 9.18.14, allowing a remote attacker to potentially execute code on the DNS server.
   - **Mitigation Details**: Changes were made to ensure that resource records are encoded correctly and special characters are properly handled by adding double quotes around certain types of records.

2. **CVE-2023-52892**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability pertains to phpseclib, where some characters in Subject Alternative Name fields in TLS certificates can be misinterpreted as regular expression wildcards, leading to host verification issues.
   - **Mitigation Details**: The fix involves using `preg_quote` to escape special characters properly and replacing wildcard symbols with a more secure pattern.

3. **CVE-2024-0440**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability is related to the acceptance of file URLs in link submissions, which could allow an attacker to access host files.
   - **Mitigation Details**: The solution involves validating protocols by checking against a list of valid ones (e.g., `https:` and `http:`) before processing.
