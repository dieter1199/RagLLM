The provided context discusses two sets of code changes related to different vulnerabilities. Let's break down the information:

1. **First Set of Changes:**
   - The context mentions a limit on the size of requests with a code snippet that limits request sizes to 5 MB and adds a middleware function (`maxBytesReader`) to restrict request body sizes.
   - Code changes include additions like `apiv2.NewAPIService` and deletions involving API v1 endpoints, indicating an upgrade or change in the API versioning.

2. **Second Set of Changes:**
   - This set addresses another vulnerability by changing how storage configurations are handled, specifically upgrading from API v1 to API v2.
   - Key changes involve functions like `ConvertStorageFromStore` and removing references to deprecated API v1 methods.

The context does not directly map these changes to specific CVE IDs but provides enough information to infer potential vulnerabilities:

- The first set of changes suggests a mitigation for handling large request bodies, which is often related to preventing denial-of-service attacks due to resource exhaustion. This aligns with issues typically addressed by CVEs like **CVE-2024-34084**.

- The second set of changes indicates an upgrade from API v1 to API v2, addressing potential vulnerabilities in the storage configuration handling. This could relate to a vulnerability like **CVE-2024-29029**, which involves fixing issues with how resources are saved and managed.

Given these analyses:

- **Retrieved CVE ID:** **CVE-2024-34084** for the first set of changes related to request size limitations.
- **Related Info:** The second set of changes could be associated with **CVE-2024-29029**, addressing API version upgrades and storage handling improvements.

No mention is made of **CVE-2024-21583** in the provided context.
