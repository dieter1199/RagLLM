To determine if any of the listed vulnerabilities apply to the provided code snippet, we need to analyze each CVE in relation to the code.

### Code Analysis

The given code snippet is a JavaScript file using Vue.js with various imports from libraries such as `@/utils`, `dayjs`, and others. It involves fetching server information and displaying it within a Vue component template. The code also includes a function call to `useServerStore()` and uses the property `info.version`.

### Vulnerability Analysis

1. **CVE-2024-27296**: This vulnerability relates to Directus, where certain files exposed version numbers using variables like `__DIRECTUS_VERSION__`. The relevant change in the fix was replacing direct version references with store-based properties (`info.version`).

   - **Relevance**: The code uses `info.version`, which aligns with the mitigation applied for CVE-2024-27296. This suggests that if this vulnerability existed, it would have been addressed by using a store property instead of exposing the version directly.

2. **CVE-2024-33883**: This affects the ejs package, which is unrelated to Vue.js or the components used here. The issue was about pollution protection in JavaScript templates, not relevant to the current code context.

   - **Relevance**: Not applicable as there are no signs of using the ejs template engine or related vulnerabilities in this snippet.

3. **CVE-2024-0440**: This vulnerability is associated with a link protocol validation issue. The fix involved validating URLs against specific protocols, which doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the operations performed by this code snippet (no URL manipulations).

   - **Relevance**: Not applicable since there's no evidence of handling or constructing URLs in a way that would expose such vulnerability.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code aligns with the mitigation strategy for **CVE-2024-27296**. The use of `info.version` instead of directly referencing a version constant like `__DIRECTUS_VERSION__` suggests this particular vulnerability has been addressed in the context of the code snippet.

Thus, the relevant CVE ID is:

- **Retrieved CVE ID**: CVE-2024-27296

This indicates that while the code was potentially vulnerable to the issue described by CVE-2024-27296, it appears to have implemented a fix by utilizing `info.version`.
