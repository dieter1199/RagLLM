To identify which CVE IDs are associated with vulnerabilities based on the provided contexts, let's analyze each one:

1. **CVE-2024-33883**: There is no context or information given regarding CVE-2024-33883 in the details you provided. Therefore, it appears that no vulnerability was found related to this ID.

2. **CVE-2024-0795**: The description mentions a potential issue with password brute-forcing through timing attacks due to linear `!==` comparison. However, there is no context or specific mention of this CVE ID in the details provided.

3. **CVE-2024-0436**: This vulnerability involves a theoretical risk of timing attacks on passwords in single-user mode. The context provided includes changes to mitigate this by using an O(1) check with `bcrypt` instead of linear comparison, which directly addresses the issue described for CVE-2024-0436.

Based on the analysis:

- **Retrieved CVE ID**: CVE-2024-0436
- **Related Info**:
  - **Description**: The vulnerability involves a timing attack risk due to linear password comparison (`!==`). This could theoretically allow brute-forcing of passwords in single-user mode.
  - **Mitigation Changes**: 
    - Changed the password check from a linear `!==` to an O(1) operation using `bcrypt`.
    - Adjusted code in files like `index.jsx` and `validatedRequest.js` to incorporate this change.

In summary, CVE-2024-0436 is associated with changes made to prevent timing attacks by improving password verification methods.
