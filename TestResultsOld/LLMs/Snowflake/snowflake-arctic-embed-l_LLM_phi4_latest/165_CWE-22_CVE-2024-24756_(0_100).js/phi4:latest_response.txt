The retrieved context pertains to CVE-2024-33883. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-33883
- **Description**: The ejs (Embedded JavaScript templates) package for Node.js, prior to version 3.1.10, lacks certain pollution protection.
- **Publish Date**: April 28, 2024
- **CWE ID**: NVD-CWE-noinfo

### Mitigation Changes:

1. **File: `ejs.js`**
   - **Modification Type**: Modification (change in code to add protection)
   - **Lines Added**: 
     - Line 509: Function signature modified to enhance security.
     - Line 510: Uses `utils.hasOwnOnlyObject(optsParam)` for better object handling.
     - Additional changes ensure that pollution is minimized by altering the default options.
   - **Lines Deleted**:
     - Line 509 and 510 had been using a vulnerable approach where default options were directly assigned, potentially leading to prototype pollution.

2. **File: `utils.js`**
   - **Lines Added**: 
     - Lines 241-249 introduce a new function `hasOwnOnlyObject`, which creates a safer object by copying properties that are own (not inherited) from the source object.
   - **Purpose**: This prevents prototype pollution by ensuring only own properties of an object are copied to a newly created object with a null prototype.
