   - The commit message is "chore: fix cors + remove unused httpmeta getter api".
   - This change involved modifications in CORS handling and removal of an API endpoint.

2. **Retrieved Contexts for Vulnerabilities:**
   - **CVE-2019-25211** involves a wildcard parsing bug fixed by altering how wildcards are handled at the end of an origin string.
   - **CVE-2024-29028** is about removing an SSRF vulnerability in memos by deleting an HTTP metadata getter API.
   - No context for **CVE-2024-29029** is provided.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The commit message and changes, especially the removal of the `/o/get/httpmeta` endpoint from `http_getter.go`, align with the mitigation for **CVE-2024-29028**, which involved removing an SSRF vulnerability by deleting this specific API.
