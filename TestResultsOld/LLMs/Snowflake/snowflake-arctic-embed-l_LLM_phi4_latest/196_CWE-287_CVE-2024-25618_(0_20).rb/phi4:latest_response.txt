The provided context includes two sets of information: one for a potential vulnerability identified by changes in code handling user input sanitization (related to XSS attacks), and another set related to role management vulnerabilities (identified as CVE-2024-0795).

1. **XSS Attack Context**: This part describes changes made to sanitize user input, specifically focusing on preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The mitigation involves removing vulnerable lines that did not properly handle URL parameters and replacing them with sanitized versions using a utility function `sanitizeHTML`. However, the CVE IDs related to this context are not explicitly mentioned in the provided details.

2. **Role Management Context (CVE-2024-0795)**: This part clearly identifies a vulnerability related to role management, where unauthorized users could potentially modify roles without proper checks, leading to security issues. The changes include implementing more robust validation for role modifications using utility functions and additional logic to ensure there is always at least one admin left in the system.

Based on the context provided, **CVE-2024-0795** is explicitly mentioned as related to the role management vulnerability. The other potential vulnerabilities (XSS attack) do not have a specific CVE ID associated with them in the given information.

Therefore, the retrieved and clearly identified CVE ID from the context is **CVE-2024-0795**, which pertains to unauthorized role modification due to insufficient validation checks.
