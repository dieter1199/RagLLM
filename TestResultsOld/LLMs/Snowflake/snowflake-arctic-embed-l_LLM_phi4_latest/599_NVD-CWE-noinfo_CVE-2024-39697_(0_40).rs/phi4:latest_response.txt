Based on the provided information:

1. **Retrieved CVE ID: CVE-2023-52426**

2. **CVE Description**: This vulnerability pertains to libexpat through version 2.5.0. It allows recursive XML Entity Expansion if `XML_DTD` is undefined at compile time.

3. **CWE Details**:
   - **CWE ID**: CWE-776
   - **Name**: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
   - **Description**: The vulnerability arises from the product's use of XML documents with Document Type Definitions (DTD) that do not properly control recursive entity definitions.

4. **Commit Message Summary**:
   - The scope for protection against the billion laughs attack was extended in `lib|xmlwf|cmake`.
   - The condition changed from just checking if `XML_DTD` is defined to also including when `XML_GE == 1`.

5. **Type of Change**: Modification

6. **Code Changes Summary**:
   - **File: expat.h**
     - Added lines: Extended protection by considering both `XML_DTD` and `XML_GE == 1`.
     - Deleted lines: Previous checks only considered `XML_DTD`.

   - **File: xmlwf.c**
     - Added lines: Included conditions for warning messages about ignored amplification limits and attack thresholds when compiled without DTD/GE support.
     - Deleted lines: Earlier warnings were specific to the absence of `XML_DTD` support.

The vulnerability was addressed by extending the checks in the code to account for both `XML_DTD` and a new condition (`XML_GE == 1`). This change ensures better protection against recursive entity expansion vulnerabilities.
