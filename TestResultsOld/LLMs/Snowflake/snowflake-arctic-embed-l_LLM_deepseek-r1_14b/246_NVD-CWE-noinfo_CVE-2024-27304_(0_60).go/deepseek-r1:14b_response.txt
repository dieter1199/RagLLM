Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer based on the context provided. The user gave me two sections of information, each under "Retrieved Context." 

In the first section, it's about a commit in pgx related to sanitizing queries and preventing SQL injection. It mentions that the changes were made in sanitize.go and sanitize_test.go files. They added lines to wrap strings in parentheses to prevent issues, which suggests they're addressing some vulnerability.

The second section seems to be about another CVE, specifically CVE-2024-27304, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the first one or a different issue. This part talks about SQL injection via line comments and references an advisory from GitHub security. It mentions that pgx v5 wasn't vulnerable to CVE-2024-27289 because of how the sanitizer was called, but there was still an underlying issue. The commit ports a fix from pgx v4 to v5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me break it down:

1. First context: Changes in sanitize.go and tests added. They fixed an SQL injection issue by wrapping arguments in parentheses.
2. Second context: This is about the same CVE-2024-27304 but explains that pgx v5 was not vulnerable to a different CVE (GHSA-m7wr-2xf7-cm9p) because of how the sanitizer worked, and now they're porting the fix from v4 to v5.

So, putting it together, both contexts are related to the same CVE, which is 2024-27304. The first part shows changes in code to mitigate SQL injection, and the second explains that this fix was necessary despite v5 not being vulnerable to another issue previously. Therefore, the retrieved CVE ID is CVE-2024-27304.

The Retrieved CVE ID is **CVE-2024-27304**. This vulnerability relates to a potential SQL injection issue that was addressed by modifying how arguments are sanitized and wrapped in parentheses to prevent exploitation via line comments. The changes were made across multiple files, including `sanitize.go` and `sanitize_test.go`, ensuring that the fix is consistent across different versions of pgx (v4 to v5).
