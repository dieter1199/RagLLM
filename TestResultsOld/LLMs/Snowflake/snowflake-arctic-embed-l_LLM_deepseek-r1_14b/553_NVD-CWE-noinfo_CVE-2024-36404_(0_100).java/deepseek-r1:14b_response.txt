Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given CVE IDs (CVE-2024-36404, CVE-2024-25638, or CVE-2024-23645) is related to the context provided. The user has given me two sets of data: one about some code changes in PHP files for a project involving DNS records and another about XSS vulnerabilities in GLPI software.

Looking at the first part, there are several files being modified like stat.location.php and stat.tracking.php. In these, they're changing how parameters are appended to URLs. Instead of directly concatenating variables into the URL string, which can be risky because it doesn't sanitize inputs, they're now using a function called Toolbox::append_params(). This is probably to properly escape the input, preventing things like SQL injection or XSS by ensuring that special characters are correctly encoded.

The second part mentions CVE-2024-23645. The description says that GLPI has an XSS vulnerability where malicious URLs can execute scripts on reports pages. The fix involves encoding special characters in forms and links to neutralize any potentially dangerous input, which aligns with the changes made in those PHP files.

So, putting this together, the code modifications are likely a response to the XSS issue described in CVE-2024-23645. They're using Toolbox::append_params() to safely build URLs, which would prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts by encoding the input correctly. This makes sense because not properly escaping user inputs is a common cause of XSS vulnerabilities.

I don't see any mention of the other two CVE IDs in the provided context, so it's safe to assume they're unrelated here. The focus is clearly on preventing XSS by sanitizing URL parameters.

The retrieved CVE ID related to the provided context is **CVE-2024-23645**.

### Related Information:
- **CVE Description**: GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. A malicious URL can be used to execute XSS on reports pages. Upgrade to 10.0.12.
- **CVE Publish Date**: 2024-02-01
- **CWE ID**: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
- **Commit Message**: Encode special chars in stats forms/links

The changes involve modifying how parameters are appended to URLs in PHP files (`stat.location.php` and `stat.tracking.php`) to properly escape input, mitigating the XSS vulnerability.
