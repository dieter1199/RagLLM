Alright, I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID is relevant here. The user provided two contexts about different vulnerabilities, one related to memory management in a Go library (CVE-2024-2221 or CVE-2024-1394) and another about the quic-go project (CVE-2024-22189). The user is asking me to retrieve the specific CVE ID based on this information.

First, I notice that the first context mentions a Go library with vulnerabilities in versions 1.17.3 and earlier, where improper memory management can cause heap-based buffer overflows or underflows. This affects functions like (*[]byte)(*rune) and others. It seems serious because it could lead to crashes or potential security issues if exploited.

The second context is about the quic-go project, specifically versions 0.21.0, 0.22.0, and 0.23.0. The vulnerability here involves not properly limiting the number of control frames queued in the framer, which could lead to a denial-of-service attack by causing memory exhaustion.

The user's query asks to provide the retrieved CVE ID or state that none was found. Looking at the information, both contexts describe different vulnerabilities with their own respective CVE IDs. However, the first part mentions "Retrieved CVE ID (CVE-2024-2221 or CVE-2024-1394 or CVE-2024-22189)", which suggests they're looking for one of these specific IDs.

I need to determine which one is applicable. The first context doesn't explicitly name the CVE ID, but mentions two possibilities: 2024-2221 and 2024-1394, both related to Go's memory management. The second context clearly states CVE-2024-22189 for quic-go.

Since the user provided both contexts, they might be asking which one applies, but it's unclear if they're looking for a specific match. However, since each context refers to separate projects and vulnerabilities, I should probably address them individually.

But wait, the user is asking me to provide the retrieved CVE ID from their given options. They listed three: 2024-2221, 2024-1394, or 2024-22189. Looking back at the first context, it says "Related Vulnerability ID (CVE-2024-2221 or CVE-2024-1394)" and the second mentions "related to ... (CVE-2024-22189)". So each context corresponds to one of those IDs.

Therefore, if I have to choose based on their request, it seems like both are present. But since they're asking for a single response, perhaps I should state that the relevant CVE ID is 2024-22189 as per the second context, which explicitly names it. Alternatively, maybe they want me to identify all applicable ones.

Hmm, but the user also mentioned "or state that no vulnerability was found," so if none match, say that. But in this case, two are provided.

Wait, actually, looking at the first part of the query, it says "Based on the above context..." and asks for the Retrieved CVE ID (listing those three) or state no vulnerability. So perhaps they're asking me to extract which specific one from their list is present in the given contexts.

In that case, both 2024-22189 and either 2024-2221 or 2024-1394 are relevant based on the two contexts. But the user lists three options: 2024-2221, 2024-1394, or 2024-22189. So I should mention all applicable ones.

Alternatively, maybe the first context is about a Go vulnerability that's either 2024-2221 or 2024-1394, and the second is specifically 2024-22189.

In any case, to answer properly, I should state all relevant CVE IDs based on the provided contexts.

Based on the context provided, the **Retrieved CVE ID** is:

**CVE-2024-22189**

This CVE relates to a vulnerability in the `quic-go` project where an improper limit on the number of control frames queued could lead to memory exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks. The issue was addressed by updating versions 0.21.0, 0.22.0, and 0.23.0.
