Okay, I need to figure out which CVE IDs are relevant based on the context provided. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the initial prompt, it mentions three CVE IDs: CVE-2021-4437, CVE-2024-24752, and CVE-2024-24754. The user wants to know which of these are related to the provided context.

The first context block discusses a vulnerability in a JavaScript library called "js-yaml". It mentions that versions 3.13.1 through 4.1.0 have an issue where untrusted YAML input can cause unsafe deserialization, leading to potential remote code execution. This is CVE-2021-4437. The fix provided includes updating the library and specifying safe settings like enabling schema and tags safely. So this one is definitely relevant.

Next, there are two other CVEs mentioned in the context: CVE-2024-24752 and CVE-2024-24754. Both of these relate to Bref, a tool for running PHP on AWS Lambda. The first describes an issue with multipart request parsing leading to incorrect output compared to plain PHP when certain keys are used, patched in version 2.1.13. The second is about improper cleanup of uploaded files, also patched in the same version.

Since all three CVE IDs were mentioned and each has its own context, I should list them all as relevant. Each has a specific vulnerability and corresponding fix information provided.

The following vulnerabilities are identified based on the provided context:

1. **CVE-2021-4437**  
   - **Description**: Vulnerability in js-yaml versions 3.13.1 through 4.1.0 allowing unsafe deserialization of YAML input, potentially leading to remote code execution.  
   - **Fix Information**: Update js-yaml to a patched version and configure safe settings for schema loading.

2. **CVE-2024-24752**  
   - **Description**: Bref vulnerability where multipart request parsing produces incorrect output when using keys ending with an open square bracket, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.  
   - **Fix Information**: Patched in version 2.1.13.

3. **CVE-2024-24754**  
   - **Description**: Bref issue with improper cleanup of uploaded files during PSR-15 handler processing.  
   - **Fix Information**: Patched in version 2.1.13, including file cleanup functionality.

All three CVEs are relevant and addressed as per the context provided.
