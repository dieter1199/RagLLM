Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the user is asking for. They provided a lot of context about two different CVEs: one from HTMLEditorSanitiser.php in some project, and another from a file named something like fonts.css in another project. The first part mentions three specific CVE IDs: 2023-49508, 2024-32489, and 2024-32981. Then there's some code changes for each, but it seems like the second part of their message is about a vulnerability in HTMLEditorSanitiser.php related to data attributes.

I think they want me to determine which CVE ID corresponds to the provided context. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first part, they mention three CVE IDs but then provide details for two: one from fonts.css with code changes and another from HTMLEditorSanitiser.php with a regex modification. The second part of their message is about disallowing 'data:text/html' in data attributes to prevent XSS attacks.

In the context provided, there are two files changed: one in HTMLEditorSanitiser.php where a regex is updated to include 'data:text/html', and another test file that adds several test cases. The commit message clearly states it's addressing CVE-2024-32981.

So putting this together, the vulnerability being addressed is CVE-2024-32981 because the changes are in HTMLEditorSanitiser.php and the commit message references that specific CVE ID. The other files (like fonts.css) don't seem to relate directly unless there's more context, but since they provided two separate sets of information, I should focus on the one with the explicit mention.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the vulnerability found is CVE-2024-32981.

The vulnerability identified in the context corresponds to **CVE-2024-32981**. 

### Summary of the Vulnerability:
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-32981
- **Description**: The vulnerability involves a server-side sanitization issue where certain data attributes (specifically `data:text/html`) were not properly sanitized, allowing potential XSS attacks.
- **Commit Message**: "[CVE-2024-32981] Disallow `data:text/html` in data attributes"
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated regex patterns to detect and block `javascript:` and `data:text/html` in attributes.
  - Added test cases to ensure proper sanitization of dangerous content.

This update addresses the vulnerability by enhancing the sanitization logic to prevent exploitation through these specific vectors.
