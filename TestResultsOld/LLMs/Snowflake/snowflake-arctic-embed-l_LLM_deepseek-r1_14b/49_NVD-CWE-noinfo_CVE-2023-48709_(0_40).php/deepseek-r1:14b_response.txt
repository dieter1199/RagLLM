Okay, I need to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the provided context. The user gave me two pieces of information: one about a vulnerability in HTMLEditorSanitiser.php where the regex was updated to include data:text/html, and another about a vulnerability in sanitising certain content.

Looking at the first context, it's from CVE-2024-24821. The changes involve modifying how data URIs are handled in HTML sanitization, specifically allowing only specific types like image formats and base64 encoding for others. This looks like a fix to prevent certain types of attacks by restricting data attributes.

The second context is from CVE-2024-32981. Here, the issue was that the regex wasn't catching data:text/html in data attributes. The commit added this to the regex, preventing dangerous content from being included. This seems like a response to a specific vulnerability where such content could be injected.

The user wants me to determine which of the three CVE IDs (24821, 35242, or 32981) is related based on their context. Since I have two contexts provided, each corresponds to one of these CVEs. 

So, for the first context, it's clearly about data URI sanitization, which matches CVE-2024-24821. The second context addresses javascript and data:text/html in attributes, aligning with CVE-2024-32981.

Therefore, both CVE IDs 24821 and 32981 are present in the provided contexts, each detailing different security fixes.

Based on the context provided:

### Retrieved CVE ID:
- **CVE-2024-24821**
  - **Commit Message**: "Restrict data:uri in content to only allow certain formats."
  - **Changes**: Modified `HTMLEditorSanitiser.php` to update regex patterns for data URIs, allowing only specific MIME types and base64 encoding for others.

- **CVE-2024-32981**
  - **Commit Message**: "[CVE-2024-32981] Disallow `data:text/html` in data attributes."
  - **Changes**: Updated regex patterns to block dangerous content like JavaScript and data:text/html URIs.

### Conclusion:
Both CVE-2024-24821 and CVE-2024-32981 are present in the provided contexts, each addressing different vulnerabilities through specific code changes.
