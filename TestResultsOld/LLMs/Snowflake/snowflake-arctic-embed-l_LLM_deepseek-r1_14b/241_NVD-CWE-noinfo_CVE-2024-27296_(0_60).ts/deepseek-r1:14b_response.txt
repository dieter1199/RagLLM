Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a given piece of code is vulnerable to any of the specified CVEs: CVE-2024-27296, CVE-2024-33883, or CVE-2024-0440. The user has provided some context about each of these CVEs and how they were addressed with specific code changes.

First, I'll start by understanding what each CVE is about based on the context provided.

1. **CVE-2024-27296**: This vulnerability was related to exposing the version number in certain parts of the application, which could allow an attacker to gather information about the system. The fix involved changing how the version is retrieved and displayed. For example, in `server.ts`, they added a line to set `info.version` from the server's response data. In `ejs.js`, there were changes to prevent pollution by ensuring that only specific properties are copied into a new object.

2. **CVE-2024-33883**: This was about insufficient protection against variable replacement (pollution) in the EJS templating engine. The fix introduced a function `hasOwnOnlyObject` which copies only own properties to prevent pollution. This means that when creating a new object for template options, it now ensures that only specific properties are included.

3. **CVE-2024-0440**: This vulnerability was due to allowing links with the file protocol, which could lead to local file inclusion attacks. The fix added validation to ensure that URLs only use HTTPS or HTTP protocols. Any URL using `file://` would now be blocked.

Now, looking at the provided code snippet:

```javascript
const VALID_PROTOCOLS = ["https:", "http:"];
// Some code here...
```

I notice that this is a list of valid protocols, which aligns with the fix for CVE-2024-0440. The commit message mentioned adding strict link protocol validation, which matches this code change. Therefore, this code snippet is likely part of the mitigation for CVE-2024-0440.

To confirm, I'll cross-reference the changes in `index.js` as described for CVE-2024-0440. The fix involved checking if the URL's protocol is in a predefined list of valid ones, which is exactly what this code does. So, it's safe to conclude that this snippet addresses CVE-2024-0440.

I don't see any evidence in the provided code that relates to the other two CVEs. The changes for those were in different files (`server.ts` and `ejs.js`) and involve version handling and object pollution protection, respectively.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the code snippet is related to CVE-2024-0440.
</think>

The provided code snippet is part of the mitigation for **CVE-2024-0440**. This vulnerability was addressed by validating that URLs only use HTTPS or HTTP protocols, preventing file protocol-based attacks.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Context**: The code defines `VALID_PROTOCOLS` as ["https:", "http:"], which matches the fix for CVE-2024-0440.
2. **Understand the Fix**: This validation ensures that URLs without HTTPS or HTTP are blocked, preventing local file inclusion via file:// protocols.
3. **Match to CVE**: The changes align with the commit message and code modifications described in the context for CVE-2024-0440.

**Answer:**  
The provided code snippet is related to **CVE-2024-0440**, which was fixed by validating that URLs use only HTTPS or HTTP protocols.
