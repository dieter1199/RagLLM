Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user has provided three different contexts related to vulnerabilities, each with a specific CVE ID: CVE-2024-0795, CVE-2024-1738, and CVE-2024-0436. However, in the detailed information provided under each context, only two CVE IDs are mentioned: CVE-2024-1738 and CVE-2024-0436. There's no mention of a vulnerability related to CVE-2024-0795.

Looking at the first context, it discusses a commit with the message "fix: get evaluation result (#181)" in index.ts. The changes involve modifying SQL queries to include a projectId check, which seems to address an authorization issue. This corresponds to CVE-2024-1738.

The second context refers to another vulnerability (CVE-2024-0436) related to password brute-force via timing attacks in single-user mode. The commit changes the password comparison from a linear check to a constant-time check using bcrypt, which makes sense as a mitigation for this kind of attack.

Since there's no context provided that mentions CVE-2024-0795, it seems like that particular vulnerability isn't present or hasn't been addressed in the given information. Therefore, based on what I've reviewed, only CVE-2024-1738 and CVE-2024-0436 are relevant here.

So, to answer the user's question: they should know that two of the three provided CVE IDs (1738 and 0436) are present with their respective details, while 0795 isn't mentioned, implying no vulnerability was found for it in this context.
