Alright, so I've been given some context about three different CVE IDs: CVE-2024-33883, CVE-2024-0795, and CVE-2024-0436. The user is asking me to determine which one is related based on the provided information or state that no vulnerability was found.

First, I notice that in the initial query, the user mentioned three CVE IDs but only provided context for two: CVE-2024-0795 and CVE-2024-0436. There's no context given for CVE-2024-33883. That might mean that the context is incomplete or perhaps that's a red herring.

Looking at the details:

1. **CVE-2024-0795**: The commit message here talks about updating user-related functionalities, like suspending and deleting users. It mentions changes in how these actions are handled, possibly fixing issues with user management permissions. The code changes involve adding checks for `canModify` and modifying how user updates and deletions occur. This suggests a vulnerability related to improper access controls or authorization bypass.

2. **CVE-2024-0436**: The commit message refers to changing password check logic to prevent timing attacks in single-user mode. Previously, there was a linear comparison (using `!==`), which could leak timing information and allow brute-force attacks. Now, they're using bcrypt's compareSync method for an O(1) time complexity, making the attack less feasible.

3. **CVE-2024-33883**: There's no context provided for this one, so I can't assess it directly.

Given that the user is asking to provide the retrieved CVE ID and related info or state no vulnerability was found, but based on the context given:

- For CVE-2024-0795, there's a clear fix in user management, indicating a prior vulnerability.
- For CVE-2024-0436, the commit addresses a timing attack vulnerability, which is a known issue.

Since CVE-2024-33883 isn't discussed, it might not be relevant or perhaps the context wasn't provided. Therefore, based on the information given, I can only address the two provided.

Based on the provided context:

1. **CVE-2024-0795**: This CVE ID is related to vulnerabilities in user management functionalities, such as suspending and deleting users. The commit message indicates that improper authorization checks were fixed.

2. **CVE-2024-0436**: This CVE ID relates to a timing attack vulnerability in password verification for single-user mode. The commit fixes this by changing the comparison logic to prevent timing leaks.

There is no context provided for CVE-2024-33883, so it cannot be assessed from the given information.
