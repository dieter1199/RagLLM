Alright, let's try to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the provided context. I'm seeing three different CVE entries here: CVE-2024-32489, CVE-2024-24539, and CVE-2024-23645. The user has given me some context about each of these, but I need to determine which one is the correct match based on the information provided.

First, looking at the first retrieved context, it mentions a vulnerability in PHP code related to encoding special characters. The changes include replacing hardcoded strings with Toolbox::append_params() and using &amp; as separators. This looks like an attempt to properly URL-encode parameters to prevent XSS attacks.

Next, the second context talks about a GLPI issue where a malicious URL can cause XSS on reports pages. The commit message mentions encoding special chars in stats forms/links, which aligns with mitigating XSS vulnerabilities by correctly handling user input and output.

The third context is about session fixation via cookies in a PHP application, specifically using a predictable session ID to hijack sessions. The fix involves generating random session IDs after login to prevent this kind of attack.

Now, the user provided three different CVEs. I need to match each context to its respective CVE. Since the first context deals with proper URL parameter handling and encoding, which is a common XSS mitigation technique, it likely corresponds to a CWE-79 (XSS) related CVE. Looking at the given options, CVE-2024-23645 has a description about GLPI's XSS vulnerability, so that's probably linked to the first context.

The second context discusses session fixation, which is typically under CWE-310 or similar categories. Among the provided CVEs, there isn't an exact match, but if I had to choose based on the information given, it might be a different one not listed here. However, since the user only lists these three, perhaps none of them directly correspond.

The third context about GLPI's XSS seems to fit with CVE-2024-23645, as both involve mitigating XSS by encoding input. Therefore, I think the first and third contexts relate to that CVE.

So, putting it all together, the user is asking to provide the retrieved CVE ID and related info or state no vulnerability. Based on this analysis, the applicable CVEs are likely CVE-2024-32489 (session fixation) and CVE-2024-23645 (XSS in GLPI). But since the user's context for the first and third match XSS, I'll focus on that.

Based on the provided context, the relevant CVE ID is **CVE-2024-23645**.
