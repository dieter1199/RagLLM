Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the provided context. Let me start by reading through the information given.

First, there's a section about three different files: Domain.java, Query.java, and Statement.java. Each has some changes made with lines added or removed. The user mentioned that these changes are from commit 87b0f1e. The files modified in each case include:

- For CVE-2024-36404: Modifications to three files with a total of 53 added and 49 deleted lines.
- For CVE-2024-25638: Changes only to Query.java, adding 1 line and deleting 1.
- For CVE-2024-24749: Another set of changes across the same three files, totaling 10 added and 16 deleted lines.

Then there's a second section with more detailed context about specific commits. The first part discusses vulnerabilities related to SQL injection in Domain.java and Query.java, mentioning that these were fixed by removing vulnerable code and adding input validation. There are also mentions of changes in Statement.java where certain methods were removed and others added for secure execution.

The second part is labeled as CVE-2024-36404, talking about a security fix with improvements in SQL query building. It references another commit (commit_id 125a89d) and mentions changes to Query.java and Statement.java.

The third context provided is under the retrieved CVE ID of CVE-2024-24749, which details a vulnerability in ByteStreamController.java. It explains that there was an issue with improper input validation leading to directory traversal attacks on Windows systems. The fix involved modifying how filenames are extracted and validated, adding checks for forbidden characters and ensuring the file paths are within allowed directories. Additionally, new test cases were added to verify these fixes.

Based on this, I need to determine which CVE ID is associated with the given context. The second section under "Retrieved CVE ID" mentions that the vulnerability is related to improper input validation in ByteStreamController.java leading to directory traversal attacks. This aligns with the description of CVE-2024-24749 provided earlier.

So, putting it all together, the correct CVE ID from the context given is CVE-2024-24749.

The retrieved CVE ID associated with the provided context is **CVE-2024-24749**. This vulnerability relates to improper input validation in `ByteStreamController.java`, which could allow directory traversal attacks on Windows systems. The fix involved enhancing filename extraction and validation processes, along with adding test cases to ensure the security measures are effective.
