Alright, I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the user's message, there are three sections each mentioning a different CVE ID: CVE-2024-5642 (which isn't listed in the provided contexts), CVE-2024-21503, and CVE-2024-34078. The user wants me to determine which one is present or if none are found.

I'll go through each section:

1. **First Section**: This part talks about a vulnerability in the `html-sanitizer` library where specially crafted HTML could escape sanitization because of Unicode normalization happening too late. It mentions a commit that moves the normalization earlier, which fixes the issue. The CVE ID here is **CVE-2024-34078**.

2. **Second Section**: This discusses a vulnerability in `black` related to processing lines with leading tabs, which could lead to denial of service due to regex issues. However, upon closer look, this section actually refers to **CVE-2024-21503**, but the details don't match the provided context exactly.

Wait, looking again, the first section is about `html-sanitizer`, which matches CVE-2024-34078. The second section seems to be another vulnerability in a different part of the codebase, possibly related to regex denial of service, but it's not explicitly tied to a specific CVE ID in the provided context.

So, focusing on the information given:

- **CVE-2024-34078**: Clearly present with details about moving normalization earlier.
- **CVE-2024-21503**: Mentioned but perhaps not fully detailed or might be another vulnerability.
- **CVE-2024-5642**: Not present in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the user's query and the context given, I should state the found CVE ID(s) with their related info. Since the first section is clearly about CVE-2024-34078, that's definitely one to include.

Based on the provided context:

### Vulnerability Identified:
**CVE-2024-34078**

### Related Information:
- **Description**: The `html-sanitizer` library normalizes Unicode characters after sanitization. This allows specially crafted HTML to escape by converting Unicode characters into chevrons (e.g., `<` or `>`). The issue is fixed by moving the normalization step earlier in the process.
- **Commit Message**: "Normalize unicode earlier"
- **Files Modified**:
  - `sanitizer.py`: Moved and adjusted Unicode normalization logic.
  - `tests.py`: Added tests to ensure the fix works correctly.
- **Fix**: Normalizes Unicode characters earlier to prevent crafted HTML from escaping sanitization.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerability **CVE-2024-34078** has been identified and addressed by modifying the normalization process in the `html-sanitizer` library.
