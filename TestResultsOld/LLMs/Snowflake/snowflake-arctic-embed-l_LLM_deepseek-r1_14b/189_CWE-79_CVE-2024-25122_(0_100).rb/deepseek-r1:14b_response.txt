Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID is associated with the given context. The user provided three different CVE entries: CVE-2024-25122, CVE-2024-35231, and CVE-2024-32887. But when I look at the details, only two are actually shown with their related context.

First, for CVE-2024-25122, there's no context provided. The user just says it wasn't found. Then, for CVE-2024-35231, there's a detailed context about a vulnerability in Sidekiq where the substr parameter is reflected without encoding, leading to XSS. It mentions that this was patched in version 7.2.4 and includes commit messages and code changes.

Next, CVE-2024-32887 is also discussed with similar details about a reflected XSS vulnerability in Sidekiq Web UI, which was fixed by updating the VERSION constant to "7.2.4".

Wait, that seems confusing because both CVE-2024-35231 and CVE-2024-32887 are talking about Sidekiq vulnerabilities. But looking closer, I see that maybe there's a mix-up here. The first context actually refers toCVE-2024-35231 being related to the 'runs' method in Rack::Profiler allowing too many profiler runs, which could lead to high CPU usage or other issues, hence the patch limiting runs based on query parameters.

The second context is about CVE-2024-32887, which is a reflected XSS vulnerability in Sidekiq's Web UI. The commit message clearly states it's for fixing that specific CVE and involves updating the version number to 7.2.4.

So, putting this together: When checking for each CVE ID provided (CVE-2024-25122 isn't found), the relevant information is tied to CVE-2024-35231 and CVE-2024-32887, each with their own fixes in different files.

Based on the context provided, the vulnerabilities associated with the given CVE IDs are as follows:

1. **CVE-2024-35231**: This vulnerability is related to a potential DoS attack via excessive profiler runs in Rack::Profiler. It was addressed by introducing a maximum limit on the number of runs based on query parameters and updating the code to handle this limitation.

2. **CVE-2024-32887**: This vulnerability involves a reflected XSS issue in Sidekiq's Web UI, where untrusted input (like the `substr` parameter) was not properly encoded before being included in the response, allowing JavaScript injection. It was fixed by updating the version to 7.2.4.

There is no information provided for CVE-2024-25122, indicating it wasn't found in the given context.

**Summary:**
- **CVE-2024-35231**: Patched with code changes in Rack::Profiler to limit profiler runs.
- **CVE-2024-32887**: Fixed by updating Sidekiq's version to 7.2.4.
- **CVE-2024-25122**: Not found in the provided context.
