Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided some context about two different CVEs: one is CVE-2024-21583 (or maybe another similar one) and another is CVE-2024-0440. They’re asking which of these CVE IDs is retrieved based on the given context.

Looking at the first part, there’s a detailed code change in files like index.js, with modifications to handle URL protocols more strictly. This seems related to ensuring that only certain protocols are allowed, probably preventing file:// links which could be dangerous. That sounds like it's addressing a vulnerability where an attacker could use file:// URLs to access local files.

The second part mentions another CVE ID, but the similarity score is 0.662, which is pretty high but not perfect. The user wants me to determine if either of theseCVE IDs (21583, 25103, or 0440) is present based on the context provided.

Wait, the first part talks about parsing Range headers in HTTP requests and handling duplicate headers, which could lead to issues like buffer overflows or improper handling. That's more of an HTTP parsing vulnerability. The second part deals with URL protocols and preventing file:// access, which is a different kind of security issue.

So, in the first context, it seems related to parsing Range headers but doesn't directly mention any specific CVE ID provided by the user. The second context clearly points to CVE-2024-0440 because it's about strictening URL protocols and includes code changes that validate against file:// attacks.

Therefore, the correct response is that the CVE ID found is CVE-2024-0440, along with its description, publish date, etc. The other CVE IDs might not be directly related to the provided context.

Based on the context provided, the **retrieved CVE ID** is:

### CVE ID: **CVE-2024-0440**

#### Related Information:
- **CVE Description**: "Attacker, with permission to submit a link or submits a link via POST to be collected that is using the file:// protocol can then introspect host files and other relatively stored files."
- **CVE Publish Date**: February 26, 2024
- **CWE ID**: NVD-CWE-noinfo
- **Commit Message**: "Strict link protocol validation (#577)"
- **Type of Change**: Modification
- **Changes**:
  - **File**: `index.js`
    - Added strict validation for URL protocols.
    - Blocked the use of file:// URLs to prevent unauthorized access to local files.

This CVE indicates a vulnerability in handling links or URLs, particularly when allowing file:// protocols, which could lead to unauthorized file system access. The fix involves validating and restricting allowed protocols (e.g., https:, http:) to mitigate this risk.
