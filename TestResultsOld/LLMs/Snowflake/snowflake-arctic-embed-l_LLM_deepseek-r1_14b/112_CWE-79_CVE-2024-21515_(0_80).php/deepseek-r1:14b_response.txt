Okay, so I need to figure out which of the provided CVE IDs is present in the given context. The options are CVE-2024-21517, CVE-2024-21515, or CVE-2024-6526. Let me start by looking through the context to see if any of these IDs are mentioned.

Looking at the first part of the context, it starts with "You are a..." which seems like an introduction but doesn't mention any CVE IDs. The next paragraph talks about being based on the provided context and mentions that no vulnerability was found. Wait, no, actually, I should read more carefully.

Wait, the user has already presented some context, and then they ask me to provide the Retrieved CVE ID or state if none were found. But in their message, I see that the initial part is a query where someone else might have asked for information based on a given code snippet. The code snippet there is:

"```php
<?php
if (!defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');
class MY_Controller extends CI_Controller {
    protected $data = [];
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->load->library('session');
        $this->load->helper('url');
        if ($this->session->userdata('user_type') == 'admin') {
            $this->data['view'] = 'admin/';
        } else {
            $this->data['view'] = '';
        }
    }

    public function redirect($url = '', $params = []) {
        return redirect($url, $params);
    }

}
?>
```

This code doesn't seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It extends CI_Controller, loads session and URL helper, checks if the user is admin, and sets a view path accordingly. The redirect method just calls the built-in redirect function.

Now, looking at the context provided earlier, I see that it's about a vulnerability with CVE ID CVE-2024-6526. The description talks about an SQL injection issue in a PHP script where user input isn't properly sanitized when querying a MySQL database. It mentions specific files like products.php and shopcategories.php where the vulnerable code is located, and it provides examples of how the code was fixed by adding htmlspecialchars() to sanitize output.

So, based on this, the provided context does mention a vulnerability with CVE-2024-6526. Therefore, I should state that this CVE ID is present in the context, along with relevant details such as the affected files and the nature of the vulnerability (SQL injection via unsanitized user input leading to database query manipulation).

Based on the provided context, the vulnerability identified is **CVE-2024-6526**. This CVE ID relates to an SQL injection issue in a PHP script where user input was not properly sanitized when constructing database queries. The affected files include products.php and shopcategories.php, where vulnerable code was present. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing proper sanitization using htmlspecialchars().

**Answer:**

The Retrieved CVE ID is **CVE-2024-6526**, which relates to an SQL injection vulnerability in the PHP script due to improper sanitization of user input when handling database queries.
