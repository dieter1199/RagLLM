Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user has provided some context about three different CVEs: CVE-2024-32489, CVE-2024-32981, and CVE-2023-52892. But looking at the details, I notice that only two are actually mentioned with their contexts.

First, there's CVE-2024-32981. The context here talks about vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin where an attacker could inject malicious code by exploiting the way URLs are handled. It mentions specific files like config.php and index.php, and how changes were made to fix this issue. So that's a real vulnerability with provided commit details.

Next up is CVE-2023-52892. This one relates to phpseclib where certain characters in TLS certificates' Subject Alternative Name fields caused issues with regular expressions, leading to potential name confusion. The context shows changes made by replacing some patterns and quotes to fix this problem. Again, it's a real CVE with commit information.

Then there's mention of another CVE ID: CVE-2024-32489. However, when I look through the provided contexts, I don't see any details or commit history related to this ID. It seems like it was listed but no actual vulnerability info is given for it. So maybe it wasn't found in the data provided.

The user asked to retrieve one of these three CVEs and provide related info or state that none were found if not applicable. Since two are present (32981 and 52892), I need to decide which one to focus on. Looking at the initial request, it's possible they might be looking for specific information about each, but since only two have details, I should probably mention both.

But wait, the user also provided an example response where only CVE-2024-32981 was detailed. Maybe they want just one based on the similarity score or priority. The highest similarity is 0.649 for 52892, which is lower than 0.673 for 32981.

I think I'll go with CVE-2024-32981 since it's more directly related to PHP applications and has clear commit details. However, mentioning that the other two are present but without info on 32489 might be helpful too.
