Based on the provided context, the most relevant CVE ID is **CVE-2024-21503**. Here are the details related to this CVE:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-21503
- **Description**: html-sanitizer is an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.
- **Publish Date**: 2024-05-06
- **Commit Message**: Normalize unicode earlier

The changes made in the code include normalizing unicode earlier in the process to mitigate the vulnerability. This is evident from the modifications in `sanitizer.py` where the normalization step is moved to an earlier stage in the processing pipeline.
