Based on the provided context, the most relevant CVE ID is **CVE-2024-0795**. The details for this CVE are as follows:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-0795
- **Description**: This vulnerability involves potential unauthorized access or manipulation due to insufficient checks on user roles and permissions, which could allow a manager with lower privileges to perform actions intended for higher-level users.
- **Mitigation Details**:
  - In `index.jsx`, changes were made to ensure that only the current user can modify their own suspension status and delete themselves from the system. This was done by adding checks to verify if the action is being performed by the current user (`currUser?.id !== user.id`).
  - Additional checks were added in `validatedRequest.js` to validate user roles before allowing any operations.

These changes help mitigate the risk of unauthorized actions by ensuring that users can only perform actions they are permitted to do based on their role.
