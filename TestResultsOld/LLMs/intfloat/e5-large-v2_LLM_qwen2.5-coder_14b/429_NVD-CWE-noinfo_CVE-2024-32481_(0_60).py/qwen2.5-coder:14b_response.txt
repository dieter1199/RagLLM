Based on the provided context, the most relevant CVE ID is **CVE-2024-27088**. The retrieved information for this CVE ID includes:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-27088
- **CVE Description**: html-sanitizer is an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.
- **CVE Publish Date**: 2024-05-06
- **CWE ID**: NVD-CWE-noinfo
- **Commit Message**: Normalize unicode earlier
- **Type of Change**: Modification
- **Changes**: 
  - In `sanitizer.py`, the normalization of Unicode is moved earlier in the process.
  - In `tests.py`, a new test `test_normalize_early` has been added to ensure that the early normalization prevents escape sanitization.
