**Related Info:**
- **Description:** The commit addresses a vulnerability in the SurveyJS library where an image link could be manipulated to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when set to "youtube" mode. The fix involves updating the domain checks for YouTube URLs and ensuring that only valid YouTube links are rendered.
- **Fix Details:**
  - Modified `question_image.ts` to include more comprehensive checks for YouTube domains (`youtube.com`, `m.youtube.com`, `youtube.com/embed/`, `youtu.be`) and prevent rendering if the link is a JavaScript URI.
  - Added unit tests in `question_imagetests.ts` to verify that invalid YouTube links are correctly identified and handled, ensuring no XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited.

This vulnerability specifically pertains to handling image links in a survey or questionnaire context where user input could potentially lead to security issues. The patch ensures that only legitimate YouTube URLs are processed, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
