Retrieved CVE ID: **CVE-2024-24754**

### Related Info:
- **Description**: This CVE is related to a potential issue in the handling of JSON mime-types within an API Gateway Proxy Event. The vulnerability could be exploited if the regex used to identify JSON content types was vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.
  
- **Commit Message**: 
  ```
  fix(json-deserializer): fixed codeQL vulnerability
  
  Removed the regex used to identify a JSON mime-type as this was potentially vulnerable to
  'Regular expression Denial of Service attacks' and making changes to make the regex more restrictive (but compliant with RFC 6838) did not pass tests for this issue online.
  
  This now matches based on the last segment of a mimetype being json or json; this should match all the expected mime types.
  
  Updated unit-tests with additional tests for a variety of compatible mime types.
  ```

- **Changes Made**:
  - In `JsonDeserializer.test.ts`:
    - Added 16 lines to create more comprehensive tests for various JSON content-type headers.
    - Removed 9 lines of the original test that only checked for "application/json".
  
  - In `JsonDeserializer.ts`:
    - Added 9 lines to split and check the MIME type more strictly, focusing on the last segment being "json".
    - Removed 5 lines of the original regex pattern used to identify JSON content types.

This update aims to mitigate the risk of ReDoS attacks by simplifying the MIME type matching logic.
