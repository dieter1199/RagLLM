Retrieved CVE ID: **CVE-2024-24821**

### Related Info:

**Description:**
The vulnerability in Composer (version 2.3.7 and earlier) allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the `installed.php` file, which is loaded during runtime without integrity checks. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious code into the `installed.php` file, leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrade to Composer 2.3.8 or later**: The vulnerability has been patched in Composer version 2.3.8 and later.
- **Disable Plugins and Scripts Temporarily**: If upgrading is not immediate, temporarily disable plugins and scripts by using the `--no-plugins` and `--no-scripts` flags with Composer commands to reduce risk.
- **Review and Secure `vendor/composer/installed.php`**: Ensure that the `installed.php` file has appropriate permissions (e.g., read-only for web servers) to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Details:**
The vulnerability affects the way Composer loads the `InstalledVersions` class. The patch introduces checks to ensure that the class is loaded safely from the Composer PHAR archive rather than directly from the vendor directory, which could be compromised.
