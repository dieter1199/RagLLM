Based on the user's code snippet and the retrieved context, I have determined that the provided code is likely vulnerable to **CVE-2024-27088**. The vulnerability involves passing functions with very long names or complex default argument names, which can cause the script to stall.

### Retrieved CVE ID: CVE-2024-27088

#### Description:
The ejs (Embedded JavaScript templates) package before 3.1.10 for Node.js lacks certain pollution protection. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate template data in ways that could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

#### Commit Message Summary:
- **Top-1 Context**: The commit message "fix: Support ES2015+ function definitions in `function#toStringTokens()`" indicates an effort to improve the handling of function definitions, but it also mentions reverting from a problematic regex-based implementation. This suggests that the original code used a regular expression to parse functions, which could lead to issues if the function names or arguments were particularly complex or long.
- **Top-2 Context**: Similar to Top-1, this commit message "fix: Support ES2015+ function definitions in `function#toStringTokens()`" also addresses the handling of modern JavaScript function syntax and reverts from problematic regex usage.

Given that the user's code snippet uses a regular expression (`regex`) to parse function names and arguments, it aligns with the description of CVE-2024-27088. Therefore, this vulnerability is applicable in this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is vulnerable to **CVE-2024-27088** due to the use of regular expressions to parse function names and arguments, which could lead to script stalling or other unexpected behavior if the function names or arguments are complex.
