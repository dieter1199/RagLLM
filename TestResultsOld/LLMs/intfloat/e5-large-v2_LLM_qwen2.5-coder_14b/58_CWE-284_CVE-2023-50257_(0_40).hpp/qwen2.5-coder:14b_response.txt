### Retrieved CVE ID: CVE-2024-30258
- **Description**: FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves a malformed `RTPS` packet, the subscriber crashes when creating `pthread`. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.

- **Type of Change**: Modification

### Changes Summary:
1. **BlackboxTestsTransportUDP.cpp**:
   - Added lines to deliver specific datagram files (`datagrams/20574.bin` and `datagrams/20660.bin`) for testing purposes.

2. **CDRMessage.h**:
   - Modified parameter reading functions to include additional parameters (`parameter_length`) to ensure proper handling of data holder sequences.

3. **ParameterSerializer.hpp**:
   - Updated the readDataHolder function to incorporate `parameter_length` for more robust data parsing, preventing crashes from malformed packets.

These changes directly address the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2024-30258 by ensuring that the system can handle malformed RTPS packets without crashing.
