### Retrieved CVE ID: CVE-2024-21583

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is related to improper handling of HTTP request headers, particularly the `Host` header. An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted requests with multiple `Host` headers to bypass certain checks and gain unauthorized access.

**Changes Summary:**
- **File:** `header.go`
  - **Language:** Go
  - **Lines Added for Mitigation:** 14
  - **Lines Deleted Vulnerable to CVE:** 20
  - **Summary of Changes:** The code now validates the `Host` header more strictly by checking if it contains invalid characters and ensuring that only one valid host is present. This prevents attacks that manipulate the `Host` header.

- **File:** `header_test.go`
  - **Language:** Go
  - **Lines Added for Mitigation:** 21
  - **Lines Deleted Vulnerable to CVE:** 0
  - **Summary of Changes:** New test cases have been added to verify that the host validation logic correctly handles various scenarios, including valid and invalid host headers.

These changes ensure that the system no longer allows bypassing security checks through manipulated `Host` headers, effectively mitigating the described vulnerability.
