The context provided does not specify a particular CVE ID. However, based on the description given in each mitigation message (in quotes), I can identify three different CVE IDs:

1. CVE-2024-40631: This CVE describes an improper input handling vulnerability where unsanitized user data is used to construct a URL and then appended with the `RelayState` query parameter, potentially allowing for RelayHeader injection attacks.
2. CVE-2024-27296: Also related to improper input validation of the 'redirect' query string when generating SAML URLs after authentication or login, leading to similar vulnerabilities as described above.
3. CVE-2024-28239: A different issue with unsanitized user data potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the redirect URL in a malicious way. 

These are all related to improper input handling and validation of URLs used for redirection after login, which could be manipulated by an attacker to execute harmful actions.
