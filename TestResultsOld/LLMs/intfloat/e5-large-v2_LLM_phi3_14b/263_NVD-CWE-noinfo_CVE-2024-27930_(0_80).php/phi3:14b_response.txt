Based on the provided information, there appears to be a vulnerability in the codebase of GLPI (Gestionnaire Comptable Libre de Paquetage Informatique), specifically within various PHP files and functions. However, the retrieved CVE IDs are not directly mentioned or referenced in the given context. The changes made to the original code suggest that there has been a mitigation effort against some form of vulnerability by sanitizing inputs using `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities` instead of direct POST variable usage.

The patched version uses `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities($entity_restrict)` to ensure the data is coming from an active session and presumably a whitelist, which helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or other potential vulnerabilities associated with improper handling of user input.

Unfortunately, without specific CVE ID information provided in the context, we cannot definitively identify the precise CVE IDs you mentioned (CVE-2024-23645, CVE-2024-27930, or CVE-2024-27937). However, given that these mitigation efforts are being applied to protect against vulnerabilities related to input sanitation and potential XSS attacks, it is likely connected to a CVE in the realm of improper handling of user inputs.

Therefore, I can't provide an exact CVE ID or specific details about them without more context or explicit references from the provided code changes. It would be necessary to further investigate the official reports and databases for those particular CVE IDs to determine their relevance or confirm if they are indeed related to these patches.
