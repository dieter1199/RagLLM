To determine if a specific CVE is associated with the changes described in the provided context, we need to analyze the code changes for patterns or descriptions typically linked to known vulnerabilities. The context involves updates across several files, mainly focusing on user permissions and admin status management.

Here's an analysis of the changes:

1. **Admin Status Management**:
   - There are multiple mentions of `is_admin` being set to `False` or `True`, especially in contexts where admin privileges cannot be removed (e.g., for default users).
   - Changes involve checks and restrictions on modifying a user's admin status, particularly ensuring that certain users remain admins.

2. **Permission Verification**:
   - Updates include changes to functions like `batch_verify_permissions`, indicating enhancements or fixes related to permission checking.
   - There is an emphasis on verifying permissions more robustly, which might address issues where improper checks could lead to privilege escalation.

3. **User Creation and Management**:
   - Modifications in user creation logic (e.g., setting default values for `is_admin`) suggest efforts to prevent unauthorized users from gaining admin privileges inadvertently.
   - Changes in how users are created or modified indicate a focus on securing user roles and permissions.

Given these observations, the changes seem to address potential vulnerabilities related to improper handling of admin status and permission verification. These types of issues often relate to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Possible CVE Associations:

- **CVE-2024-2213**: If this CVE is known for issues related to privilege escalation due to improper admin status management or permission checks, it could be relevant.
- **CVE-2024-2032 and CVE-2024-2035**: Similarly, if these CVEs involve vulnerabilities in user role management or permission verification leading to unauthorized access, they might also be applicable.

### Conclusion:

Without specific details about the CVEs (such as descriptions from a CVE database), it's challenging to definitively match them to the changes. However, based on the nature of the updates—focusing on admin status and permission checks—it is likely that these changes address vulnerabilities similar to those described in privilege escalation or improper access control scenarios.

If any of the mentioned CVEs (CVE-2024-2213, CVE-2024-2032, CVE-2024-2035) are related to such issues, they could be relevant. However, without explicit descriptions, we cannot conclusively state which, if any, CVE these changes address. Therefore, based on the provided information alone, no specific vulnerability (by ID) can be definitively identified as being resolved by these changes.
