The provided contexts describe changes made to codebases in response to specific vulnerabilities. Let's analyze each context to determine the relevant CVE IDs:

1. **CVE-2024-32879:**
   - Description: The change involves replacing `get` calls with explicit checks for existence using `select_related` and an if-condition, likely addressing issues like potential `DoesNotExist` exceptions when fetching related objects.
   - Code Changes:
     - Added lines involve checking the UID explicitly before returning a social object.
     - Removed lines used `get()` directly, which could raise exceptions if the object didn't exist.

2. **CVE-2024-36105:**
   - Description: This vulnerability involved binding to all network interfaces (`INADDR_ANY` or `IN6ADDR_ANY`), potentially exposing an application on unsecured networks.
   - Code Changes:
     - Added lines bind explicitly to `127.0.0.1` instead of using a blank address, which would bind to all available interfaces.
     - Removed lines previously bound to `""`, representing binding to all network interfaces.

3. **CVE-2024-29199:**
   - No context or description is provided for CVE-2024-29199 in the given data.

Based on the changes described:

- The changes related to replacing `get` with explicit existence checks correspond to **CVE-2024-32879**.
- The changes related to binding network interfaces explicitly to `127.0.0.1` instead of all interfaces correspond to **CVE-2024-36105**.

Therefore, the retrieved CVE IDs are **CVE-2024-32879** and **CVE-2024-36105**, with their respective descriptions provided above. No context was given for **CVE-2024-29199**, so it is not included in the findings.
