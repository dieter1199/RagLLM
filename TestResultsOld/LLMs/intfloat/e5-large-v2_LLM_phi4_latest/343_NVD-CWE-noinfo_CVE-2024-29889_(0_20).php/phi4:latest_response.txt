The provided information indicates changes made across various PHP files within a project. These changes involve replacing direct uses of the `$_POST['entity_restrict']` variable with calls to `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities($_POST['entity_restrict'])`. This pattern is typically associated with mitigating vulnerabilities where user input is directly used without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing for unauthorized access or manipulation.

The consistent application of this mitigation strategy across multiple files suggests that a specific vulnerability was identified and addressed. The changes imply that the original code might have been susceptible to attacks such as injection or improper access control due to unsanitized user input.

While the exact CVE ID is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the pattern of mitigation strongly indicates an attempt to address a known security vulnerability. Given the nature of the changes and their widespread application across different files, it is reasonable to infer that one of the listed CVEs—CVE-2024-23645, CVE-2024-27930, or CVE-2024-27937—is related.

To determine which CVE ID specifically applies, additional context such as vulnerability descriptions from official sources like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) would be necessary. However, based on the provided information alone, we can conclude that one of these CVEs was indeed addressed through the changes described.

In summary, a vulnerability was found and mitigated, likely corresponding to one of the mentioned CVE IDs: CVE-2024-23645, CVE-2024-27930, or CVE-2024-27937. Further investigation into official vulnerability databases would be required to pinpoint the exact CVE ID.
