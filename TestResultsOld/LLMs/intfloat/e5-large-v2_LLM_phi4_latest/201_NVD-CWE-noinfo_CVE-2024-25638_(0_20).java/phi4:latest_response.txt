#### CVE-2024-25638

- **Description**: This CVE is associated with a vulnerability in the handling of HTTP header values. Specifically, it involves an issue with the `X-XSS-Protection` header, where it fails to remove spaces from its value.
  
- **Related Change**:
  - The code change addresses this by ensuring that trailing spaces are removed using the method `headerValue = headerValue.trimEnd();`.
  - It also adds a check for empty header values: if the trimmed header value is empty (`if (headerValue.isEmpty()) { continue; }`), it skips further processing.
  
- **References**:
  - The change references section 5.2 of RFC 7230, which discusses handling header fields in HTTP.

#### CVE-2023-52892

- **Description**: This CVE relates to a vulnerability found in the way regular expressions are handled within a certain software context. Specifically, it involves improper escaping of regex characters, leading to potential security issues such as injection attacks.
  
- **Related Change**:
  - The code modification ensures that all non-alphanumeric characters in a given input (`host`) are properly escaped using `Pattern.quote()`.
  - This change is specifically applied when creating a regex pattern: `String hostRegexp = "^" + Pattern.quote(host) + "$";`.

#### CVE-2024-31983

- **Description**: The vulnerability associated with this CVE pertains to improper authorization checks for document translation bundles in an application. It involves insufficient access control, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate document translations.
  
- **Related Change**:
  - The code update includes enhanced authorization checks by verifying that authors of documents defining translation bundles have the necessary rights.
  - This involves checking both `CONTENT_AUTHOR` and `AUTHOR` permissions against various scopes (`ON_DEMAND`, `SCOPE`) using an `authorizationManager`.
  - Additional references to document and entity references are made for more precise access control: `EntityReference entityReference;`.
