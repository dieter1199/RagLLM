### CVE-2024-4941

**Description:**  
The issue involves improper handling of uploaded file paths that may include directory traversal sequences such as "../", allowing attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Related Info:**
- **Impact:** 
  - Potential exposure of sensitive files like config or credentials.
  - Could allow full system compromise if executed with root privileges.
  
- **Fixes:**
  - The fix involves sanitizing file paths by removing traversal sequences and validating filenames against allowed characters.

### CVE-2024-2206

**Description:**  
This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the server's code, where attackers can inject malicious scripts through crafted inputs. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Related Info:**
- **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized script execution within users' browsers.
  - Potential for cookie theft or data manipulation.

- **Fixes:**
  - Implementation of robust input validation and output encoding mechanisms to prevent injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
