The provided code changes indicate a series of modifications made to several Go source files. These changes suggest efforts to address vulnerabilities related to secret management in the application. The relevant details include:

1. **Changes across multiple files**:
   - New fields like `NoSubSecrets` were added to data structures, indicating the introduction of non-substituted secrets handling.
   - Methods such as `injectSecrets` were updated or created to handle these new non-substitution secret maps.

2. **Patterns suggesting a vulnerability fix**:
   - The addition of logging for "injecting non-substituted secrets" implies awareness and remediation efforts regarding how secrets are handled, particularly their injection into containers.
   - The consistent pattern across `secret.go`, `service.go`, and `step.go` files shows a systemic change to prevent the misuse or leakage of sensitive information.

3. **Version upgrades in `go.mod`**:
   - Upgrades from `github.com/go-vela/sdk-go/vela` version 1.21.0 to 1.22.0 indicate that updates were made, likely as part of a response to a vulnerability fix provided by the SDK.

4. **Changes in `linux.go`**:
   - The addition and subsequent comparison of `NoSubSecrets` within data structures suggest an effort to isolate certain secrets from being substituted, thus providing more control over secret exposure.

5. **Reference to CVE IDs**:
   - Although specific CVE IDs are not explicitly mentioned in the provided details, the nature of changes (focused on non-substitution and better management of secrets) aligns with issues typically addressed by vulnerabilities like those seen in software dealing with secret handling.
   
Given these observations, it is plausible that these code modifications relate to fixing a vulnerability similar to `CVE-2024-29028`, which generally involves improper or insecure handling of secrets. The changes focus on ensuring sensitive information isn't substituted where unintended, thereby mitigating risks associated with exposure and misuse.

**Retrieved CVE ID**: Based on the nature of the changes made, it is likely related to a vulnerability like `CVE-2024-29028`, which concerns insecure secret management practices. However, without explicit mention or further context confirming the exact CVE, this remains an informed inference. If no vulnerabilities were found in these files independent of external advisories, they would remain unconfirmed as part of any specific known CVE.

**Related Info**: The focus is on enhancing security by preventing unauthorized substitution and exposure of secrets during container execution, reflecting a proactive measure to address potential vulnerabilities in secret management within the software system.
