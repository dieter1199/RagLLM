The provided context includes changes made to address vulnerabilities associated with three different CVE IDs: CVE-2024-21583, CVE-2024-32869, and CVE-2024-27302. Below is a summary of the relevant information for each:

1. **CVE-2024-21583**
   - **Description**: This vulnerability relates to an issue where a URL with a `.` (dot) at the beginning could bypass validation checks due to improper handling during encoding and decoding. The problem occurred because a dot in front of a path segment would turn into `%2e/`, which was incorrectly processed as if it were two segments.
   - **Mitigation**: The fix involved changing how the URL was decoded, ensuring that any leading dots in path segments were correctly managed by using `decodeURI` instead of `decodeURIComponent`.
   - **Changes**:
     - File: `index.ts`
       - Modified Line 33 to use `decodeURI(c.req.path)` instead of `decodeURIComponent(url.pathname)`, changing the logic for URL decoding.

2. **CVE-2024-32869**
   - The context does not provide information related to this CVE ID. Therefore, no details are available regarding its description or changes associated with it in the provided data.

3. **CVE-2024-27302**
   - **Description**: This vulnerability involved a flaw in CORS policy handling within the go-zero framework. Specifically, using `strings.HasSuffix` for origin checking allowed bypassing restrictions via malicious domains.
   - **Mitigation**: The fix addressed this by converting both the origin and allowed domains to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that only exact matches or valid suffixes were accepted.
   - **Changes**:
     - File: `handlers.go`
       - Modified logic to convert origins and allowed values to lowercase and adjusted the matching mechanism to prevent bypassing CORS policies.

In conclusion, CVE-2024-21583 and CVE-2024-27302 have been addressed with specific changes as described. No information regarding CVE-2024-32869 is provided in this context.
