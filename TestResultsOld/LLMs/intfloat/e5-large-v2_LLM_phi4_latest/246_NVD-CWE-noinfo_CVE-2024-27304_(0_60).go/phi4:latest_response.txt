The retrieved CVE ID is **CVE-2024-27304**. Here's the relevant information:

### Summary of CVE-2024-27304

- **Description**: This vulnerability pertains to `pgx`, a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. It involves a potential SQL injection risk if an attacker can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the calculated message size could result in one large message being split into multiple messages under the attacker's control.
- **Resolution**: The vulnerability is resolved in versions v4.18.2 and v5.5.4 of `pgx`.
- **Workaround**: As a temporary measure, user input that could cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB should be rejected.

### Code Changes Related to CVE-2024-27304

#### Modifications in `sanitize.go`
- **Type of Change**: Modification
- **Added Lines**:
  - Added comments and logic to prevent SQL injection via line comment creation.
  - Wrapped arguments in parentheses as a mitigation measure against SQL injection.
  
```go
// Line_Reference 66: 
// Line_Reference 67:             // Prevent SQL injection via Line Comment Creation
// Line_Reference 68:             // https://github.com/jackc/pgx/security/advisories/GHSA-m7wr-2xf7-cm9p
// Line_Reference 69:             str = "(" + str + ")"
```

#### Modifications in `sanitize_test.go`
- **Type of Change**: Modification
- **Added Lines**:
  - Updated test cases to reflect the new behavior of wrapping arguments in parentheses.

```go
// Line_Reference 135:             expected: `select (42)`,
// Line_Reference 140:             expected: `select (1.23)`,
// ...
```

- **Deleted Vulnerable Lines**:
  - Removed old test expectations that did not wrap arguments, which could have been vulnerable.

```go
// Line_Reference 135:             expected: `select 42`,
// Line_Reference 140:             expected: `select 1.23`,
// ...
```

### Commit Message Summary

The commit message indicates a fix was applied to the SQL sanitizer to wrap arguments in parentheses, preventing potential SQL injection via line comment creation. This change addresses an underlying issue that previously existed and ensures future safety if the sanitization process is altered.

Overall, these changes aim to enhance security by addressing a specific vulnerability related to SQL injection through large message sizes in `pgx`.
