The provided contexts relate to two different vulnerabilities identified by their CVE IDs: CVE-2024-32481 and CVE-2024-34078. Let's break down the information for each:

1. **CVE-2024-32481**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability is associated with `html-sanitizer`, an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. The issue arises when using the default setting of `keep_typographic_whitespace=False`. During this process, Unicode characters are normalized to NFKC form at the end, which allows certain characters to escape sanitization due to their normalization into chevrons.
   - **Fix**: This vulnerability was addressed in version 2.4.2 by normalizing unicode earlier in the processing.
   - **Changes**:
     - The `sanitizer.py` file saw modifications where the unicode normalization process was moved up. Specifically, the code now performs normalization to NFC or NFKC depending on the `keep_typographic_whitespace` setting earlier than before.
     - A new test case was added in `tests.py` to ensure this early normalization prevents crafted HTML from escaping sanitization.

2. **CVE-2024-34078**:
   - This appears to be a repetition of CVE-2024-32481, likely due to the similarity in their descriptions and fixes, but with a different CVE ID.

Given that both descriptions are identical and refer to the same fix related to `html-sanitizer`, it's clear they pertain to the same vulnerability. Therefore, **CVE-2024-32481** is the accurate identifier for this issue as provided in your context.

In conclusion, the relevant information pertains to CVE-2024-32481 (also mirrored in CVE-2024-34078), related to `html-sanitizer` and its unicode normalization process.
