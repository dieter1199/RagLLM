To determine if any of the mentioned vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-36404, CVE-2024-24749, or CVE-2024-28198) are present in your code context, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **CVE-2024-36404**: This CVE is not detailed in the provided context. Therefore, we have no specific changes related to this vulnerability.

2. **CVE-2024-24749**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability affects GeoServer 2.21.0 through 2.23.x and involves a potential Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when using the WPS (Web Processing Service).
   - **Changes in Code**:
     - The code changes involve switching to a secure XML parser for processing SVG documents.
     - Specifically, the `DocumentBuilderFactory` is replaced with `XMLFactories.newDocumentBuilderFactory()` from `org.geotools.xml`. This change aims to prevent SSRF by ensuring that external entities are not processed.

3. **CVE-2024-28198**:
   - **Description**: This vulnerability affects OpenOlat and involves SSRF through the draw.io integration, allowing arbitrary file access.
   - **Changes in Code**:
     - The mitigation involves using a secure XML parser by replacing `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()` with `XMLFactories.newDocumentBuilderFactory()` from `org.olat.core.util.xml`.

Based on the provided code changes:

- The change to use `XMLFactories.newDocumentBuilderFactory()` is associated with CVE-2024-28198.
- The change to use `org.geotools.xml.XMLFactories.newDocumentBuilderFactory()` is associated with CVE-2024-24749.

Therefore, the relevant retrieved CVE ID based on your code context is **CVE-2024-24749**. This is due to the changes involving `org.geotools.xml.XMLFactories`, which are specific to GeoServer's SSRF vulnerability mitigation.
