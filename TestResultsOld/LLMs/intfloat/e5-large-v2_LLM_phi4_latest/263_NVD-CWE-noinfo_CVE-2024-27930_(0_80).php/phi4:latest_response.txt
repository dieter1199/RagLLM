The provided information outlines various code changes made to address potential vulnerabilities in a software project. The key change involves the use of `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities()` function across multiple files and scripts. This suggests an effort to mitigate a security issue related to entity management or access control, possibly by ensuring that only active entities are considered when processing requests.

To determine which CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) ID is associated with these changes, we need to consider the nature of the vulnerability being addressed:

1. **CVE-2024-23645**: This CVE typically involves issues related to improper handling of entity identifiers, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation if inactive entities are not properly filtered.

2. **CVE-2024-27930**: This CVE might involve vulnerabilities in session management or data validation processes that could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

3. **CVE-2024-27937**: This CVE often pertains to issues with entity access controls, where improper checks could allow attackers to bypass restrictions and manipulate data.

Given the context of the changes—focusing on ensuring only active entities are processed—it is likely that these modifications address a vulnerability related to entity management and access control. The use of `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities()` aligns well with mitigating issues like those described in CVE-2024-23645 or CVE-2024-27937.

Considering the specific focus on filtering active entities, it seems most relevant to **CVE-2024-23645**, which involves improper handling of entity identifiers and ensuring only valid (active) entities are processed. However, without explicit confirmation from a vulnerability database or release notes, this is an informed assumption based on typical patterns seen in such vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**: The changes likely address **CVE-2024-23645**, focusing on ensuring that only active entities are considered to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
