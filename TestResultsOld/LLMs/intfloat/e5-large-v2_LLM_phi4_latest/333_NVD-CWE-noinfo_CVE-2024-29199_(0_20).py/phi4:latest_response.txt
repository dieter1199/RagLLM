The changes described in the provided context relate to a specific set of code modifications for addressing vulnerabilities. Let's analyze each one:

1. **Code Changes:**
   - The first set of changes involves modifying redirection logic in files like `DeviceEdit.tsx`, `RouterContext.tsx`, and several others, where they replace certain usages of functions such as `router.replace` with `pushAndReplace`. This modification seems to be related to ensuring proper navigation handling.
   - The second set involves security improvements by adding sanitization for the `redirectPath` parameter using a library (`@braintree/sanitize-url`) in TypeScript files. This specifically targets preventing reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

2. **CVE Identification:**
   - The first set of changes does not directly relate to any specific CVE mentioned, as it primarily deals with navigation and routing logic improvements.
   - The second set of changes explicitly mentions a commit message related to sanitizing URLs to prevent XSS issues in the sign-in page, which matches the description for **CVE-2024-30264**. This vulnerability involves reflected XSS due to unsanitized `redirectPath` parameters on a chatbot builder's sign-in page.

3. **Comparison with Provided CVEs:**
   - **CVE-2024-29199**: Not described in any provided context.
   - **CVE-2024-34707**: Involves sanitizing banner content for preventing injection attacks, unrelated to the routing and navigation changes described here.
   - **CVE-2024-30264**: Matches with the XSS issue related to `redirectPath` sanitization.

Based on this analysis, the retrieved CVE ID is **CVE-2024-30264**, which involves mitigating a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability by ensuring that URLs are sanitized.
