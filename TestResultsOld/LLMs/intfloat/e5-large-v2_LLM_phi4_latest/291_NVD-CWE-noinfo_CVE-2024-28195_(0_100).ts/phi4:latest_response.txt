The provided code changes and descriptions do not explicitly mention any specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers such as CVE-2024-30264, CVE-2024-24758, or CVE-2024-28195. Instead, the context highlights various security improvements and fixes that have been implemented in the codebase:

1. **Security Enhancements:**
   - **MIME Sniffing Prevention:** The addition of `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers is a defensive measure to prevent MIME type sniffing by browsers, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Cryptographic Improvements:**
   - **Random String Generation and SHA256 Hashing:** Importing cryptographic functions from the `crypto` module and implementing secure random string generation (`generateRandomString`) and hashing (`sha256`). This enhances the security of sensitive operations such as private key management.

3. **Code Refactoring:**
   - **Use of More Secure Methods for Randomness:** Transition from `randomUUID()` to `generateRandomString(32)` for generating JWT private keys, suggesting a move towards more secure and possibly entropy-rich random string generation methods.
   
4. **Routing and Middleware Improvements:**
   - The inclusion of routes (`search.ts`) with proper validation and security checks indicates an effort to improve the robustness of API endpoints.

5. **CORS Policy Enhancement:**
   - Although not explicitly stated, changing CORS policy from "all" to specific origins (implied by using `get("CORS")?.split(",")` instead of a blanket "all") reflects better control over cross-origin requests and reduces the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or other CORS-related vulnerabilities.

The changes focus on strengthening security through preventive measures rather than addressing specific known vulnerabilities identified by CVE identifiers. Therefore, based on the provided context, no direct link to CVE-2024-30264, CVE-2024-24758, or CVE-2024-28195 is found. The updates appear to be proactive improvements for better security hygiene rather than reactive patches for specific CVEs.

**Conclusion:** No specific vulnerability was mentioned in relation to the given CVE identifiers; instead, general security enhancements were implemented.
