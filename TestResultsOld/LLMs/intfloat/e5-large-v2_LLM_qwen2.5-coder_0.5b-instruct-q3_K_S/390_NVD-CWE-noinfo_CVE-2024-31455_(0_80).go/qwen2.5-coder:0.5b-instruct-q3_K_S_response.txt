Vulnerability: CVE-2024-29029

Description:
The vulnerability is detected in the `container.go` file of the `github.com/minder/minder` repository. It involves a memory exhaustion issue where an attacker can create large templates that are generated from maliciously created templates. The attacker can limit this by setting the `MaxAttestationsBytesLimit` configuration to 10MB, which limits the size of the attestation endpoint and the maximum number of bytes we're willing to read from the attestation endpoint.

Impact:
Minder will crash if it tries to generate large enough templates that are generated from maliciously created templates. This vulnerability can be exploited by leveraging various attack vectors such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the `v1` package or directly creating malicious templates within the application.

Severity:
High severity due to its impact on the integrity and security of the `container.go` file, which contains multiple critical functions responsible for generating large templates.
