CVE-2024-24752

The context states that there is an issue with the code in `JsonDeserializer.ts` related to a regular expression denial of service (RDoS). Specifically, it mentions that the regex `/\d+\.json$/` has been used to identify a JSON MIME-type as it is potentially vulnerable to RDoS attacks.

The context also states that the changes were made to make the regex more restrictive (but compliant with RFC 6838) and did not pass tests for this issue online.

Based on these findings, no vulnerability was found.
