After analyzing the provided context, I can extract the following information:

**Retrieved CVE ID:**
No clear match is found between the provided context and a known CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). However, two possible CVE IDs are hinted at:

* `CVE-2024-24752` is not mentioned explicitly in the provided text.
* `CVE-2024-24754` is mentioned, but it seems to be an incorrect or incomplete match.

**Most likely match:**
Based on the context, I would suggest that the most likely match is `CVE-2021-4437`, which corresponds to "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity". This CVE ID appears in the third and fifth matches extracted from the context.

Here's a summary of the relevant information:

* **CVE-2021-4437**: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
	+ Description: The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.
	+ Fixed by updating the regex to make it more restrictive (compliant with RFC 6838) and adding additional tests for various compatible mime types.

Please note that without further information or context, I couldn't confirm whether `CVE-2024-24754` is indeed a valid CVE ID. If you have any additional details or clarification regarding this potential match, I'd be happy to help further!
