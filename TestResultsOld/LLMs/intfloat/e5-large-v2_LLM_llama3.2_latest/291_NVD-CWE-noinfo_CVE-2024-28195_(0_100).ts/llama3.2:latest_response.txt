Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any information about a specific CVE (Common Vulnerability Enumerations) ID. The provided text appears to be a list of changes made to various files in a codebase, but it doesn't mention any vulnerabilities or security issues.

However, I can provide some general information about the types of vulnerabilities that might be relevant to this context:

* `nosniff` is a header that prevents MIME sniffing in browsers, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker.
* The use of `subtle.digest()` from the Web Cryptography API, as mentioned in `crypto.ts`, provides a way to securely hash and verify data. This function is considered secure and should not introduce any known vulnerabilities.

Without more information about the specific changes made or the context in which these changes were made, I couldn't determine if there are any security vulnerabilities present in this codebase. If you have any additional information or context, I may be able to provide a more detailed assessment.
