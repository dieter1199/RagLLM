Based on the provided context, I can retrieve the following information:

**Retrieved CVE ID:**
No single CVE ID stands out as being clearly matched to all three sets of contexts. However, it seems like there is one CVE ID mentioned explicitly in the first set:
- **CVE-2024-4030**

Additionally, the second and third sets of contexts mention specific CVE IDs:

**Top Result (Similarity 0.846):**
*   **CVE-2024-1433**

These are two distinct Vulnerability Identifiers.

**Note:** There is no clear indication that any of these CVEs directly match the information provided in all three sets of contexts. The first set mentions a different CVE ID: **CVE-2024-39903**, but this CVE ID does not appear to be relevant to the other two sets of contexts, which focus on KDE Plasma Workspace vulnerabilities.

**No vulnerability was found for all three contexts as they were not directly matching information in those specific lines.
