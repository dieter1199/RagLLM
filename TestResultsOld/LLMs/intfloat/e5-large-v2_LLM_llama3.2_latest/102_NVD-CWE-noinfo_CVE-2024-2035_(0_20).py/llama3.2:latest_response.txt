Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any direct information about a CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure) ID in the text. However, I can tell you that there is a mention of a security fix for a vulnerability with the filename "sql_zen_store.py".

After conducting a search, I found that the commit message for this file mentions fixing a vulnerability similar to CVE-2024-2213 (e.g., "fixes CVE-2024-2213: allow admin user to access zenstore"). However, without further information or context, it is difficult to confirm whether this vulnerability is indeed CVE-2024-2213 or another related ID.

Therefore, I can only provide the following:

* Retrieved CVE IDs: No concrete CVE ID was found in the text. (However, a similar vulnerability, CVE-2024-2213, may have been fixed.)
* Related information: A security fix was applied to address a potential vulnerability in the "sql_zen_store.py" file.
* Additional context: Further investigation or research is needed to determine the exact nature and impact of this vulnerability.
