After analyzing the provided context, I can see that there are three different CVE IDs mentioned:

1. `CVE-2024-27296` is not present in the context, but it seems to be a typo or a missing ID.

2. The top result for `CVE-2024-25410`:
   - `cve_id`: `CVE-2024-25410`
   - `cve_description`: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance.
   - `cve_publish_date`: 2024-07-08
   - `wewe_id`: NVD-CWE-noinfo
   - `commit_message`: Merge pull request from GHSA-jgf4-vwc3-r46v
   - `type_of_change`: Modification

3. The top result for `CVE-2024-39896`:
   - `cve_id`: `CVE-2024-39896`
   - `cve_description`: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance.
   - `cve_publish_date`: 2024-07-08
   - `wewe_id`: NVD-CWE-noinfo
   - `commit_message`: Merge pull request from GHSA-jgf4-vwc3-r46v
   - `type_of_change`: Modification

All three CVE IDs have the same description, but only one of them is explicitly mentioned as a "vulnerability". This might be due to a typo or missing information in the context.

However, if we look at the provided context more closely, it seems that there are two vulnerabilities:

1. `CVE-2024-25410`: Fixed in version 10.13.0.
2. `CVE-2024-39896`: Modified to prevent enumeration of existing SSO users.

Since both CVE IDs have similar descriptions and fix versions, it's likely that they are related to the same vulnerability. Therefore, I will provide information on the top result for `CVE-2024-25410`.

**Related Info:**

* Fix version: 10.13.0
* Description: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance.
* CWE ID: NVD-CWE-noinfo (Note: This might not be a valid CWE ID, as it's mentioned as "NVD-CWE-noinfo")

If you want more information on `CVE-2024-39896`, I can try to provide that based on the provided context.
