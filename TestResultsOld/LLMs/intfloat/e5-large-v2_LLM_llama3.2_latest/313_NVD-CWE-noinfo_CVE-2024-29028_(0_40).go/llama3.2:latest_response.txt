No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code changes. The `deleted_vulnerable_lines` field is empty for each file, indicating that there are no lines of code that have been deleted due to a vulnerability.

However, it's worth noting that the `injected_non_substituted_secrets` and `noSubSecrets` maps seem to be used in some files. If these maps contain sensitive information, it may be worth reviewing them for potential security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the `reflect.DeepEqual(a.NoSubSecrets, b.NoSubSecrets)` line is used to compare two identical maps, which can help prevent unexpected behavior if the maps are not updated correctly. However, without more context, it's difficult to say whether this comparison is necessary or sufficient.

Overall, while no vulnerabilities were found in the provided code changes, it's always a good idea to perform thorough security testing and reviews to ensure that your code is secure.
