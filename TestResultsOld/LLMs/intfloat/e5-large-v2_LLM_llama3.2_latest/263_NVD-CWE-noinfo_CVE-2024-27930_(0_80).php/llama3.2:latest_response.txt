After analyzing the provided context, I was unable to find any direct reference to a CVE ID (e.g. CVE-2024-23645, CVE-2024-27930, or CVE-2024-27937) in the text. The text appears to be related to a vulnerability scan or security audit, but it does not mention any specific vulnerabilities or their corresponding CVE IDs.

However, I can suggest that if you have any additional information or context about the vulnerability scan or security audit, such as the type of vulnerability or the tools used for scanning, it might help me provide more accurate information.
