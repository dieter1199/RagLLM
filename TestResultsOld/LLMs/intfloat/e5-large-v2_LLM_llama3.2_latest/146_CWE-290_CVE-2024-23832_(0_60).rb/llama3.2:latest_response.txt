After analyzing the provided context, I was unable to find any information about a specific CVE ID (CVE-2024-32983, CVE-2024-25636, or CVE-2024-23832). The context appears to be related to code changes and mitigation efforts in an OpenAPI specification generator, but it does not provide any information about vulnerabilities or CVE IDs.

Therefore, I must state that **no vulnerability was found**, as there is no mention of a known vulnerability in the provided context. If you have any further information or clarification regarding the context, I may be able to help you better.
