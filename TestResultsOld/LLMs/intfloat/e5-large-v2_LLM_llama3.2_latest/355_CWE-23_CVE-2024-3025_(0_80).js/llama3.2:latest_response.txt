**CVE-2024-5211**

A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets.

**Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:**

* Application compromise
* Denial of service (DoS) attacks
* Unauthorized admin account takeover

The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation.
