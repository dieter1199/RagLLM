Based on the provided code snippet, I am not sure if there is a matching CVE.

The code appears to use the `function#copy` method in combination with a regular expression to create a new function. However, without more information or additional context, it's difficult for me to determine if this code matches any known CVEs.

I will check the retrieved top-2 and top-3 contexts. 

Since top-1 contains a high similarity (0.860) match with the given top-1 content, but top-1 also matches with another ID, I'll provide information related to that specific match.

Top-1 context contains CVE-2024-27088 from es5-ext and passing functions with very long names or complex default argument names into `function#copy` or `function#toStringTokens` may cause the script to stall. This does not seem to match the provided code snippet, as it appears to be using a different method for creating functions.

Top-2 context contains CVE-2024-27088 from es5-ext and supports ES2015+ function definitions in `function#toStringTokens()`. However, there is no clear indication that this matches the provided code snippet.

Top-3 context contains CVE-2024-33883 from ejs (aka Embedded JavaScript templates) package before 3.1.10 for Node.js lacks certain pollution protection and does not seem to match the provided code snippet.

Based on the information available, I was unable to find a clear indication that there is a matching CVE.
