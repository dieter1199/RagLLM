Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given CVE IDs (CVE-2024-29199, CVE-2024-34707, or CVE-2024-30264) is related to the context provided. Let me start by looking at each part carefully.

First, I see that there are three sections of retrieved contexts, each associated with a different CVE ID: one mentions CVE-2024-34707, another CVE-2024-30264, and the third might be another. Wait, noâ€”the first part under "Retrieved context" doesn't specify aCVE ID; it just talks about changes in files like nautobot_config.py.j2 and settings.py, which seem related to branding banners and HTML sanitization.

The second part mentions CVE-2024-34707 with details about modifications in those files, especially adding lines that mention limiting HTML or introducing CSS and JavaScript paths. This seems like a fix for XSS because they're now restricting what kind of content can be displayed in the banners.

Then there's a third context mentioning CVE-2024-30264, which is about Typebot's sign-in page having an XSS vulnerability due to not sanitizing the redirectPath parameter. The commit adds a fix by using sanitizeUrl from a library.

Wait, but the user asked for the Retrieved CVE ID from three options: 29199, 34707, or 30264. From the context, I see that:

- The first context doesn't specify a CVE ID.
- The second section is under CVE-2024-34707.
- The third section is under CVE-2024-30264.

So, both 34707 and 30264 are present in the provided context. Therefore, the answer should include these two CVE IDs along with their respective details as per the context given.

Based on the provided context, two vulnerabilities were identified:

1. **CVE-2024-34707**: This vulnerability involves reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in Nautobot's sign-in page. The commit adds measures to sanitize and restrict HTML content in banners, enhancing security by limiting user input to prevent arbitrary script execution.

2. **CVE-2024-30264**: This issue is related to Typebot's sign-in page, where an attacker could hijack a user's account using a reflected XSS via the `redirectPath` parameter. The fix involves sanitizing this parameter to ensure it doesn't execute arbitrary JavaScript.

These changes mitigate potential security risks by improving input validation and content restrictions in both Nautobot and Typebot applications.
