Okay, I'm trying to figure out the right answer for this query. The user provided a detailed context with three different CVEs: 2024-36404 (which wasn't actually retrieved), 2024-24749, and 2024-28198. They want me to determine which one was found or if none were.

First, I notice that in the context provided, only two CVEs are mentioned: 2024-24749 and 2024-28198. The third option, 2024-36404, isn't present. So maybe the user made a typo or included it by mistake.

Looking at each CVE's details:
- CVE-2024-24749 involves issues in OpenOLAT with file inclusion and SSRF via Draw.io integration.
- CVE-2024-28198 relates to issues in OpenOlat, specifically when using the draw.io integration, allowing arbitrary file reads.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The user's context actually shows:
- For 2024-24749, it's about OpenOLAT and Draw.io.
- For 2024-28198, also OpenOLAT with Draw.io issues.

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify which CVE matches the given context. The user provided two top contexts: one for 2024-24749 (similarity 0.835) and another for 2024-28198 (similarity 0.835). Both are about OpenOLAT, which is confusing because both seem similar.

Wait, no. Actually, the first context under 2024-24749 talks about issues with file reading and SSRF in Draw.io integration. The second context under 2024-28198 also discusses similar vulnerabilities but fixed in different versions. So each CVE is separate but related to the same product.

So, if I'm to answer based on the provided data, the user's query includes three options: 36404, 24749, and 28198. But from the context, only 24749 and 28198 are present.

I think the key is to state that the retrieved CVEs are 2024-24749 and 2024-28198, providing their details as they're both in the context. However, since the user asked for one CVE ID, maybe it's better to point out that both were found and provide each with their info.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread, and only one was actually present. Let me check again:

- The first block mentions "Retrieved top-1 context..." with 2024-36404 but no details.
- Then it lists two more: 2024-24749 and 2024-28198, each with their own details.

So the correct approach is to note that two CVEs were retrieved: 2024-24749 and 2024-28198. But since the user's options are three specific ones, including one not present (36404), maybe I should list both found ones.

I think in the response, it's best to state that two CVEs were found: 2024-24749 and 2024-28198. Then provide their respective details as given.
