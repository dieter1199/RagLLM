Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided some context about three different CVEsâ€”CVE-2024-4068, CVE-2024-27088, and CVE-2024-28863. Each of these has a description and some related code changes from commit messages.

The user wants me to determine which of these CVE IDs is associated with the context provided or state that no vulnerability was found. From what I understand, each CVE entry in the context includes details like the ID, description, publication date, CWE ID, commit message, type of change, and specific code lines modified.

Looking at the first context, it's about a vulnerability where an attacker can generate a large number of sub-folders to consume memory. The fix sets a default limit on the depth of subfolders. This sounds like it's related to handling deep folder structures safely.

The second context talks about node-tar and preventing excessive subfolder extraction by setting a max depth, which aligns with the first one in terms of limiting nested folders to prevent crashes.

Wait, but the user mentioned three CVE IDs: 2024-4068, 27088, and 28863. However, in the provided context, only 27088 and 28863 are listed with their details. There's no information for 4068, which might mean that it's not present or hasn't been addressed yet.

I need to make sure I'm answering correctly. The user is asking based on the provided context, so if none of the three CVEs match, I should say no vulnerability was found. But in this case, two are listed with their info, so perhaps they're related to those specific CVE IDs.

Wait, actually, looking at the details: the first part mentions "Retrieved top-1 context" but doesn't specify the CVE ID correctly. Then it lists three contexts for different CVEs. So the user is asking to identify which of the three listed CVEs are present in the context.

In the provided data, I see that two of them have details: 27088 and 28863. The first one might be a mistake because it's listed as top-1 but without the correct ID. So perhaps the user intended to list all three, but only two are correctly detailed.

Therefore, based on the context provided, I can retrieve CVE IDs 27088 and 28863 with their related info. The third one (4068) isn't present here, so it's not found in this context.

Based on the context provided:

1. **Retrieved CVE ID**:  
   - **CVE-2024-27088**  
     Related Info: This vulnerability involves a Node.js tar file extraction issue where an attacker could generate excessively deep folder structures to consume memory and crash the system. The fix introduces a limit on subfolder depth (default 1024) to prevent this.

2. **Retrieved CVE ID**:  
   - **CVE-2024-28863**  
     Related Info: This vulnerability also relates to Node.js tar file extraction, where deep nesting of folders could cause memory exhaustion and system crashes. The fix sets a default maximum depth for subfolders (1024) with an option to override.

No information was provided about **CVE-2024-4068**, so no vulnerability details are available for it in the given context.

---

**Summary**:  
The retrieved CVE IDs and their related info are:  
- CVE-2024-27088 (Node.js tar extraction issue with deep folder nesting).  
- CVE-2024-28863 (Same Node.js tar extraction issue with deep folder nesting).  

No vulnerability details were provided for **CVE-2024-4068**.
