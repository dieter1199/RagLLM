Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID is associated with the given context. The user provided two sets of information. First, there's a long code snippet that seems like part of a project, possibly using Astro or another framework. It mentions something about SRI hashes and CSP headers, which makes me think it's related to web security.

Looking at the first part, I see references to "integrity" attributes and changes made in a file called astro.config.mjs. The code seems to be modifying how SRI (SubResource Integrity) is handled. They added some lines enabling static and middleware for SRI and specified allowed URLs for scripts. At the same time, they removed some old configuration lines that were probably vulnerable.

In the second part, there's a mention of CVE-2024-30250. The description talks about Astro-Shield allowing bypass of allow-lists by adding valid integrity attributes to injected code. This means attackers could trick the browser into thinking resources are legitimate because they have the right hashes. It also notes that this was fixed in version 1.3.2.

Putting it together, the changes in the code look like a response to patching a vulnerability related to SRI and CSP headers. The fact that CVE-2024-30250 is specifically mentioned as being patched by modifying these configurations strongly suggests that this is the relevant CVE ID here.

So, based on the context provided, especially the changes in astro.config.mjs and core.test.mts, along with the mention of CVE-2024-30250's details, it seems clear that the vulnerability being addressed is indeed CVE-2024-30250. The user didn't provide any context related to the other two CVE IDs mentioned (CVE-2024-1739 or CVE-2024-26152), so those aren't relevant here.

The vulnerability identified in the provided context is **CVE-2024-30250**. This CVE relates to a security flaw in Astro-Shield versions 1.2.0 to 1.3.1, where bypassing allow-lists for cross-origin resources was possible by introducing valid `integrity` attributes. The patch introduced modifications to ensure scripts are correctly hashed and allowed only specified URLs, as seen in the changes to `astro.config.mjs` and `core.test.mts`.

**Answer:**  
The relevant CVE ID is **CVE-2024-30250**, which has been patched by modifying configurations to enhance SubResource Integrity (SRI) handling.
