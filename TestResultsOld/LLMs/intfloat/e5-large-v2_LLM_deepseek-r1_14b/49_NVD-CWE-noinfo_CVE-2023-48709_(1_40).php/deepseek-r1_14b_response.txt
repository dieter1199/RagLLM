Alright, so I need to figure out whether the user's provided code has a vulnerability related to the CVE-2024-25410. From what I understand, this CVE is about an issue in the file upload functionality where improper validation allows attackers to upload arbitrary files.

Looking at the context given, there's a PHP script that handles file uploads. The user provided both old and new code snippets after the vulnerability was supposedly fixed. 

In the old code, lines 38-40 check if the uploaded file's type is in allowed types and its extension as well. But maybe this wasn't strict enough or missed some checks.

In the updated code, they added a check for both MIME types and extensions, also validating against a list of allowed image MIME types. Plus, they introduced a $max_file_size limit to prevent large files from being uploaded.

I need to see if these changes address the issues outlined in CVE-2024-25410. The vulnerability likely involved bypassing file type checks, so by explicitly checking both MIME type and extension, and limiting file size, they've made it harder for attackers to exploit.

But wait, does the updated code also check if the filename is safe? Maybe there's a risk of directory traversal or other injection attacks if not handled properly. The new code uses $filename_parts which might come from the uploaded file's nameâ€”could that be manipulated?

Also, checking if $max_file_size is correctly enforced and defined elsewhere in the config. If it's set to a reasonable size and being used properly, that should prevent large files from overwhelming the server.

In summary, while they've made improvements by adding MIME type checks and limiting file sizes, I should note potential areas like filename sanitization that could still be risky if not handled correctly.

**Vulnerability Found: CVE-2024-25410**

The provided context indicates the presence of a vulnerability related to the CVE-2024-25410, which involves improper validation in the file upload functionality. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient checks on the uploaded file's type and extension, allowing attackers to bypass restrictions and upload arbitrary files.

### Key Details:
- **Old Code Issues**: The initial implementation lacked strict validation for both MIME types and file extensions, potentially permitting unauthorized file uploads.
- **Updated Measures**: The updated code introduces additional security checks by validating against a list of allowed image MIME types and explicitly checking the file extension. It also enforces a maximum file size to mitigate risks.

### Conclusion:
While improvements have been made, there are still potential risks such as directory traversal or injection attacks if filename handling isn't sufficiently sanitized. Ensure that all user-supplied filenames are validated for safety and that $max_file_size is correctly enforced across the application.
