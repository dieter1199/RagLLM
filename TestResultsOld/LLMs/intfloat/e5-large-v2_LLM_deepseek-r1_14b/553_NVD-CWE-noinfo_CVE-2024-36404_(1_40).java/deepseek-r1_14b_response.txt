Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a detailed context of some code changes related to Java libraries, specifically Geotools and Apache Commons Text. They mentioned that these changes address vulnerabilities in certain CVEs, including CVE-2024-36404.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to determine if the vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-36404 exists based on the provided context or state that it's not present. If it does exist, I should start my response with "Vulnerability Found," otherwise with "Secure."

Looking at the context, the user listed several files where changes were made: XmlXpathUtilites.java, StreamingParserTest.java, etc. These changes involve replacing older libraries like Apache Commons Text 1.8 with newer versions (2.0 or later), which I know fixes a vulnerability called CVE-2023-47568. 

The user also mentioned another vulnerability, CVE-2024-36404, but the context doesn't directly relate to that ID. The provided code changes don't reference CVE-2024-36404. Instead, they focus on updating dependencies and using safer methods like JXPathUtils.newSafeContext().

I should check if there's any indirect connection or if perhaps the user made a mistake in linking the CVEs. Since the context doesn't mention CVE-2024-36404 at all, it's likely that this specific vulnerability isn't addressed here. The changes are about different CVEs, mainly 2023-47568.

Therefore, based on the information given, I can conclude that CVE-2024-36404 isn't present in the context provided by the user.
