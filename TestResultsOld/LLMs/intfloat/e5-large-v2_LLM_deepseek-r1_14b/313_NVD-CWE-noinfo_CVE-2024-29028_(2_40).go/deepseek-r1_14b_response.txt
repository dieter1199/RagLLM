Okay, I need to determine whether the user's code has any vulnerabilities based on the provided context. The user shared their Go code which defines some API endpoints using Echo framework and interacts with a getter package. They also provided context about a specific CVE, CVE-2024-29028.

Looking at the retrieved context for CVE-2024-29028, it mentions that memos version 0.13.2 had an SSRF vulnerability at /o/get/httpmeta which allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate internal networks. This was fixed by removing the API in version 0.16.1.

Now, examining the user's code. The code defines two endpoints: /get/meta and /get/pic. For both, they parse the URL query parameter and use it with getter functions (GetHTMLMeta and GetImage). There are proper checks for empty URLs and invalid URLs using url.Parse. 

In the context provided, the vulnerability was in an endpoint named /o/get/httpmeta, which isn't present in the user's code. The user's endpoints are different: /get/meta and /get/pic. Since the vulnerable endpoint was removed in a later version, and it's not part of the user's current setup, there's no evidence of that specific SSRF vulnerability here.

Therefore, the user's code doesn't seem to have the issue described in CVE-2024-29028 because they aren't using the /get/httpmeta endpoint that was fixed. Their endpoints are separate and don't trigger the same vulnerability.

Secure

The provided code does not include the `/o/get/httpmeta` endpoint, which is where the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-29028 exists. The user's code defines endpoints for `/get/meta` and `/get/pic`, which are separate from the vulnerable endpoint.
