Alright, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed context about some code changes and mentioned three possible CVE IDs: CVE-2024-4941, CVE-2024-2206, or CVE-2024-0964. The task is to determine which one is relevant based on the given context or state that no vulnerability was found.

First, I need to look at the context provided. It mentions that the code changes were made in response to a security issue related to path traversal. Specifically, the `utils.py` file had an import change from `from typing import OrderedDict` to `from collections import OrderedDict`. This suggests that there was an issue with importing the wrong module, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if not fixed.

Next, I should check each CVE ID mentioned to see if any of them match this scenario. Let's go through each one:

1. **CVE-2024-4941**: This might be related to path traversal in some context, but without specific details, it's hard to say. However, the code changes don't seem to directly address a path traversal vulnerability.

2. **CVE-2024-2206**: Again, this could be a generic security issue, but again, the changes don't point specifically to this CVE.

3. **CVE-2024-0964**: This one is mentioned in the context provided. The description says it's about an unauthenticated file inclusion vulnerability due to improper validation of user input leading to path traversal. That aligns with the code change where they fixed an import issue, which could have led to incorrect module usage and potential security risks.

Putting this together, the relevant CVE ID here is CVE-2024-0964 because it relates directly to a file inclusion vulnerability that the code changes seem to address. The other two CVEs aren't specifically tied to the provided context.

Based on the context provided, the **Retrieved CVE ID** is:

**CVE-2024-0964**

### Related Info:
- **Vulnerability Description**: The vulnerability involves an unauthenticated file inclusion issue caused by improper validation of user input, leading to potential path traversal attacks.
- **Mitigation**: The code changes appear to address this vulnerability by fixing import statements and ensuring proper module usage (e.g., importing `OrderedDict` from the correct module).
