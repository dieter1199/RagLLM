Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at the user's question where they provided some context about a vulnerability and are asking me to determine which CVE ID is associated with it or if none exists.

First, I see the user mentioned three possible CVE IDs: CVE-2024-25618, CVE-2024-1741, and CVE-2024-28239. They also provided a detailed context section about a vulnerability with the ID CVE-2024-28239.

In the context they shared, there's a lot of information about Directus, a web application framework. The description talks about an issue where unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive data through the REST API by exploiting improperly set CORS policies. They also provided a link to a GitHub repository with examples and PoC code, which is a common practice when reporting vulnerabilities.

Looking further into the context, there are sections that describe how the vulnerability was discovered and reported. The reporter reached out via email and GitHub issues, leading to patches in version 10.12.7. This indicates that it's an actively addressed issue with clear documentation of the fix.

Additionally, the user included details about how this vulnerability relates to another known CVE, specifically CVE-2023-48344. This cross-referencing is important because it shows that the issue has been recognized and linked to existing security literature.

Given all this information, it's clear that the vulnerability described corresponds to CVE-2024-28239. The other two IDs mentioned (CVE-2024-25618 and CVE-2024-1741) aren't discussed in the context provided, so they don't seem relevant here.

Therefore, based on the detailed context given, I can confidently say that the vulnerability is indeed linked to CVE-2024-28239.
