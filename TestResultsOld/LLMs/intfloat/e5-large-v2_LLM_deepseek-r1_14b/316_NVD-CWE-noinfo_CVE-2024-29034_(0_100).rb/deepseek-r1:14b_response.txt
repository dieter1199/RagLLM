Alright, let's break this down. The user provided three different CVE entries with their associated contexts. They want me to figure out which one is the right match based on the given files and changes.

First, looking at the first context: CVE-2024-29034. It involves modifying how content types are handled in permissions_policy.rb and permissions_policy_test.rb. The key change is removing a condition that checks if the response is HTML before setting the Permissions-Policy header. This makes sense because they want the policy to apply to all content types, not just HTML.

The second context is CVE-2024-28103, which deals with SSRF in CoverController.php. The fix involves making proxy image content types configurable and validating them properly.

The third is CVE-2024-25737, also about SSRF in CoverController.php, similar to the second one but from a different commit.

Since the user's query mentions "Retrieved CVE ID (CVE-2024-29034 or...)", it seems they're focusing on three specific IDs. The provided files relate to permissions_policy, which aligns with CVE-2024-29034. The changes involve removing checks that limited the policy to HTML responses, thus fixing the vulnerability.

So, putting it together, the correct CVE ID is 2024-29034, and I'll explain how the code changes mitigate the issue.

Based on the context provided:

1. **CVE-2024-29034**:
   - **File**: `permissions_policy.rb`
   - **Lines Changed**: The function `html_response?` was removed or modified to allow serving the Permissions-Policy header for all content types, not just HTML responses.
   - **Summary**: This change ensures that the Permissions-Policy header is applied to all content types, including non-HTML ones like `image/svg+xml` and `application/xml`.

2. **CVE-2024-28103**:
   - **File**: `CoverController.php`
   - **Lines Changed**: The commit introduces a new function `isValidProxyImageContentType` to validate allowed content types for proxy requests, making the cover proxy legal content types configurable.
   - **Summary**: This change mitigates a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability by ensuring that only valid and allowed content types are proxied.

3. **CVE-2024-25737**:
   - **File**: `CoverController.php`
   - **Lines Changed**: Similar to CVE-2024-28103, this change involves validating proxy requests based on configurable allowed content types.
   - **Summary**: This change addresses a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability by ensuring that only valid content types are proxied.

Based on the context provided, the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-29034 is associated with modifying permissions policy handling in `permissions_policy.rb` and `permissions_policy_test.rb`.
