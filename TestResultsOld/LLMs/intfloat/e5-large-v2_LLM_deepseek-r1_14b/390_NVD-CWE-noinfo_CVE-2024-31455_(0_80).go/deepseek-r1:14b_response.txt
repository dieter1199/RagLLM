Okay, I need to figure out which of the given CVE IDs (CVE-2024-31455, CVE-2024-29029, or CVE-2024-35194) is related to the provided code context. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, I see that there are two main sections in the user's query. The first one lists several files with changes related to a vulnerability. The second section provides additional context about another CVE, specifically CVE-2024-35194, and shows how it was addressed in the code.

Looking at the initial part, the code modifications involve changing function names from "convertStorageFromStore" to "ConvertStorageFromStore", which suggests a refactor or perhaps fixing an issue where naming conventions were inconsistent. This doesn't seem directly related to a security vulnerability but more about code style or readability.

The second part discusses CVE-2024-35194, which is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to memory exhaustion in Minder engine when processing large templates. The fix involves limiting the size of data read from an attestation endpoint to 10MB and using LimitReader to prevent excessive memory usage.

Comparing this with the first part, there's no direct overlap because the first changes are about storage conversions, while the second is about template parsing and memory limits in a different file (container.go). The files mentioned (e.g., container.go, telegram.go) don't relate to each other in terms of functionality.

Therefore, the initial code context doesn't seem to address any of the listed CVE IDs. The only CVE mentioned is 2024-35194, but it's provided separately as additional context, not part of the main query.

Based on the provided context, no vulnerability related to the specified CVE IDs (CVE-2024-31455, CVE-2024-29029, or CVE-2024-35194) was found in the code snippets provided. The changes appear to be refactoring or style updates rather than addressing a security vulnerability.

However, additional context was provided about CVE-2024-35194, which is related to a denial-of-service vulnerability in Minder engine due to memory exhaustion from maliciously created templates. This vulnerability was addressed by limiting the size of data read from an attestation endpoint to 10MB and using `io.LimitReader` to prevent excessive memory usage.
