Alright, I need to figure out which CVE IDs are relevant based on the context provided. The user has given me three blocks of text, each containing information about a different CVE ID: CVE-2023-50257, another mention of CVE-2023-50257 (possibly a typo), and CVE-2024-30258. 

First, I notice that the first two blocks are labeled as "Retrieved top-1 context" and "Retrieved top-2 context," both with the same CVE ID: CVE-2023-50257. The third block is labeled as "Retrieved top-3 context" with CVE-2024-30258.

Looking at each block, the first one describes a vulnerability where an attacker can send malformed RTPS packets causing a denial of service by crashing the subscriber process. It mentions that versions up to 2.14.0 are affected and provides details about the commit and changes made as fixes.

The second block seems similar but might be a duplicate or another angle on the same CVE, though it's not entirely clear due to formatting issues.

The third block introduces another vulnerability, CVE-2024-30258, which also involves malformed RTPS packets causing subscriber crashes via pthread creation issues. This one affects different versions and was patched in specific updates.

I should list each unique CVE ID with their respective details as provided. Since the first two blocks are about the same CVE (assuming a typo), I'll treat them as one entry but note any discrepancies or duplicates. The third is a separate vulnerability.

So, to answer the user's query, I'll provide both CVE IDs with their descriptions and associated information from the context given.

Based on the context provided, two vulnerabilities are mentioned:

### 1. **CVE-2023-50257**
   - **Description**: FastDDS (a C++ implementation of DDS) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when processing malformed RTPS packets. This can cause subscriber processes to crash.
   - **Details**:
     - Affected versions: Prior to 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8.
     - The vulnerability arises when a publisher sends malformed RTPS packets, leading to crashes in subscriber processes.
   - **Commit Message**: "Merge pull request from GHSA-53xw-465j-rxfh\n\nSigned-off-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>"

### 2. **CVE-2024-30258**
   - **Description**: Another vulnerability in FastDDS where processing malformed RTPS packets can lead to a crash when creating `pthread`, resulting in a DoS attack.
   - **Details**:
     - Affected versions: Prior to specific patches in 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8.
     - Fixes involve changes in `CDRMessage.h` and `ParameterSerializer.hpp`.
   - **Commit Message**: "Merge pull request from GHSA-53xw-465j-rxfh\n\nSigned-off-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>"

Both vulnerabilities involve issues with handling malformed RTPS packets in FastDDS, leading to potential crashes and DoS conditions.
