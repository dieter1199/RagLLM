Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the vulnerability described in the context provided. The user has given me three possible CVE IDs: CVE-2024-28866, CVE-2024-27302, and CVE-2024-25410. I need to determine which one is correct based on the information given.

Looking at the first context snippet, it talks about a vulnerability in a Go (Golang) web application where an unauthenticated attacker can trigger arbitrary file creation by exploiting improper handling of image uploads. The details include that an attacker can create files with extensions like .php and .txt in specific directories, leading to potential remote code execution or directory traversal attacks. This was patched in version 1.5.0. The related info includes a GitHub link and MITRE ID M-23-0004.

The second context snippet discusses a vulnerability in the Go Web Framework where an attacker can cause memory exhaustion by sending large amounts of data, leading to high CPU usage and service unavailability. This was fixed in version 1.4.5, with related info from GitHub and MITRE ID M-23-0003.

The third context snippet is about a vulnerability in a PHP-based CMS where an authenticated user can upload files with arbitrary extensions into the uploads directory. The attacker could execute code via these files if they contain malicious content. This was patched in version 2.8.5, with related info from GitHub and MITRE ID M-23-0002.

The user's query is asking to retrieve the correct CVE ID (from the three provided) and related information or state that no vulnerability was found.

I need to match each context snippet to its respective CVE ID. Let me go through them one by one:

1. First context: Golang web app, file upload vulnerability leading to RCE or directory traversal. Patched in 1.5.0, MITRE M-23-0004.
2. Second context: Go Web Framework, memory exhaustion via data flood. Patched in 1.4.5, MITRE M-23-0003.
3. Third context: PHP CMS, authenticated file upload with arbitrary extensions. Patched in 2.8.5, MITRE M-23-0002.

Now, the user provided three specific CVE IDs and wants to know which one applies. The first context's CVE ID is CVE-2024-28866, second is CVE-2024-27302, third is CVE-2024-25410.

So each context snippet corresponds directly to its respective CVE ID and MITRE ID. Therefore, the correct response would list each with their details as provided.
