Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID corresponds to the given commit message. The user has provided three different context entries with their respective CVE IDs and details. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each context entry is about. Each one seems to describe a security vulnerability and the corresponding fix made in some codebase, likely through a git commit or similar change tracking system.

Looking at the first context:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-39697
- **Commit Message**: "Revert 'src/asterisk.c: Fix handling of uninitialized pointers when creating a new PBX instance.' This reverts PR #123. Resolves: #GHSA-somehash."
- **Type of Change**: Deletion
- **Files Changed**: asterisk.c, 5 lines deleted.

The second context:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-35190
- **Commit Message**: "Revert 'res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip: Add endpoint identifier transport address.' This reverts PR #602. Resolves: #GHSA-qqxj-v78h-hrf9."
- **Type of Change**: Deletion
- **Files Changed**: pjsip_configuration.c and res_pjsip.h, with 5 and 2 lines deleted respectively.

The third context:

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2022-48624
- **Commit Message**: "Shell-quote filenames when invoking LESSCLOSE."
- **Type of Change**: Modification
- **Files Changed**: filename.c, with 8 new lines added and 2 deleted.

Now, the user has provided a commit message to analyze:

```
commit-message: Revert "src/asterisk.c: Fix handling of uninitialized pointers when creating a new PBX instance." This reverts PR #123. Resolves: #GHSA-somehash.
```

From this, I can see that the commit is reverting a change made in `src/asterisk.c`, specifically related to fixing uninitialized pointers when creating a new PBX instance. It mentions resolving an issue with GHSA-somehash.

Looking at the provided contexts:

1. The first context (CVE-2024-39697) matches exactly because it's also a revert commit in `asterisk.c` related to handling uninitialized pointers and references the same PR #123.
   
   - **Commit Message Matching**: Both mention reverting changes in `src/asterisk.c` about uninitialized pointers and PBX instance creation.
   - **Type of Change**: Both are deletions, removing 5 lines each.
   - **GHSA Reference**: The first context has `#GHSA-somehash`, which aligns with the commit message's reference to `#GHSA-somehash`.

2. The second context (CVE-2024-35190) involves reverting changes in `pjsip_configuration.c` and `res_pjsip.h`, which doesn't match our commit message about `asterisk.c`.

3. The third context (CVE-2022-48624) is a modification, not a deletion, and deals with shell-quoting filenames, which isn't related to the uninitialized pointers issue.

Therefore, based on the exact matches in the commit message, file changed, type of change, and GHSA reference, the correct CVE ID for this context is **CVE-2024-39697**.
</think>

The retrieved CVE ID for the provided commit message is **CVE-2024-39697**. 

**Related Information:**
- **Commit Message**: The commit reverts a change in `src/asterisk.c` related to handling uninitialized pointers when creating a new PBX instance, reverting PR #123.
- **Type of Change**: Deletion of 5 lines from the file.
- **GHSA Reference**: It resolves an issue tracked by `#GHSA-somehash`.

This indicates that the commit is reverting changes to fix a security vulnerability in Asterisk, specifically related to uninitialized pointers and PBX instance creation.
