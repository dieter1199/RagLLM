Alright, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking me to provide the Retrieved CVE ID based on the context given, which includes two examples: one with CVE-2024-21512 and another with CVE-2024-37298. They also mention that if no vulnerability is found, I should state that.

First, looking at the first example, it's about a Go package called gorilla/schema. The problem was in how structs were converted from form values, especially when dealing with arrays of other structs. This could lead to memory exhaustion because the decoder didn't limit the size of slices created based on user input. The commit message indicates that version 1.4.1 fixed this by adding a maxSize parameter.

The second example is about a vulnerability in a JavaScript package where using certain functions without proper sanitization could allow remote code execution. It mentions that the patch involved adding input validation and output escaping to prevent these attacks.

Now, the user wants me to retrieve the top-3 context with CVE ID CVE-2024-21507. However, when I look through the provided examples, there's no mention of CVE-2024-21507. Instead, I see two different CVE IDs: 2024-21512 and 2024-37298.

So, since the user is asking for CVE-2024-21507 but that ID isn't present in the given context, I need to state that no vulnerability was found. It's possible that they might have made a typo or mixed up the IDs, so it's good to clarify that.

I should structure my response clearly, stating that no vulnerability with CVE-2024-21507 was found and provide a brief explanation of the given examples in case there's confusion.

No vulnerability with CVE ID **CVE-2024-21507** was found in the provided context. However, based on the retrieved information:

### Retrieved CVE ID: **CVE-2024-37298**
- **Description**: A memory exhaustion vulnerability in `gorilla/schema` when decoding structs with arrays of other structs. The decoder creates sparse slices without limiting their size, leading to potential attacks.
- **Published Date**: 2024-07-01
- **Commit Message**: Added a maxSize parameter to limit slice creation and prevent memory exhaustion.

### Retrieved CVE ID: **CVE-2024-21512**
- **Description**: A vulnerability in a JavaScript package where improper sanitization of user input could allow remote code execution via crafted requests.
- **Published Date**: 2024-37298
- **Commit Message**: Patched by adding input validation and output escaping to prevent attacks.

If you meant a different CVE ID, please provide additional details or clarify!
