Okay, let's see. The user has given me some context about three different CVEs: 2024-21583, 2024-32869, and 2024-27302. They want me to determine which one is the correct match based on the provided context or state that no vulnerability was found.

First, I need to understand what each CVE is about. From the context:

- **CVE-2024-21583** involves a Go application with an issue in handling CORS headers. The commit modifies how the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set by checking if the origin matches exactly or is a subdomain, which fixes the bypass vulnerability.

- **CVE-2024-32869** relates to a TypeScript file where changes were made to prevent directory traversal in static file serving. The code now checks if the filename contains ".." and returns 404 if it does, enhancing security by preventing path traversal attacks.

- **CVE-2024-27302** is about a CORS issue in Go-zero framework where a malicious domain could bypass CORS policy. The fix involves checking origins more securely by using exact matches and ensuring domains are properly compared without allowing suffix-based bypasses.

The user provided context for each of these CVEs, showing the code changes made to mitigate them. The task is to match the correct CVE ID with its related info or indicate no vulnerability if none apply.

Since all three have been discussed in the context, and each has specific details about their vulnerabilities and fixes, I should present each one clearly with their respective details.

Based on the provided context, here are the **Retrieved CVE IDs** and their related information:

---

### 1. **CVE-2024-21583**
- **Related Info**: The vulnerability involves an issue in handling CORS headers, where a malicious domain could bypass CORS policy by exploiting a suffix-based check. This was fixed by ensuring that the origin matches exactly or is a subdomain of the allowed domains.
  - **Commit Message**: "fix: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key"
  - **Code Changes**:
    - File: `handlers.go`
      - Added mitigation lines to handle CORS origins more securely.
      - Deleted vulnerable lines that used `strings.HasSuffix` for checking origins.

---

### 2. **CVE-2024-32869**
- **Related Info**: The vulnerability relates to a directory traversal issue in a Go application where static files could be accessed outside the intended path. This was fixed by ensuring that only valid static files are served and preventing access to paths containing "..".
  - **Commit Message**: "fix: Static file serving security"
  - **Code Changes**:
    - File: `index.ts`
      - Added mitigation lines to check for ".." in filenames.
      - Deleted vulnerable lines that exposed the full filesystem.

---

### 3. **CVE-2024-27302**
- **Related Info**: The vulnerability involves a CORS bypass issue in the Go-zero framework, where malicious domains could exploit the CORS policy. This was fixed by ensuring that origins are checked exactly and subdomains are properly validated.
  - **Commit Message**: "fix: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key"
  - **Code Changes**:
    - File: `handlers.go`
      - Added mitigation lines to handle CORS origins more securely.
      - Deleted vulnerable lines that used `strings.HasSuffix` for checking origins.
