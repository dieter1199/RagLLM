Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to figure out which CVE ID is relevant here: CVE-2024-40631, CVE-2024-36043, or CVE-2024-38519. 

First, looking at the user's query, they provided two blocks of context. The first block seems to be about a software change related to YouTube DL (yt-dlp), specifically mentioning lines added and removed in files like YoutubeDL.py, __init__.py, and options.py. The commit message refers to disallowing unsafe extensions due to CVE-2024-38519. 

The second block is about a different vulnerability, but it's not directly linked to the three CVE IDs mentioned. It talks about a security advisory for yt-dlp again, but without specifying which CVE it corresponds to.

So, focusing on the first block: the commit message explicitly mentions "[core] Disallow unsafe extensions (CVE-2024-38519)". This directly ties the changes made in the code to that specific CVE ID. The code modifications include adding functions to catch unsafe extensions and modifying options related to allowing them, which are mitigations for the vulnerability.

The other two CVE IDs mentioned in the user's query (CVE-2024-40631 and CVE-2024-36043) aren't referenced here. The context provided only discusses CVE-2024-38519, which is about unsafe file extensions leading to potential attacks if not properly handled.

Therefore, based on the information given, the relevant vulnerability is CVE-2024-38519, and no mention is made of the other two CVE IDs.

Based on the context provided, the **retrieved CVE ID** is **CVE-2024-38519**, and it is related to yt-dlp (a fork of youtube-dl). The vulnerability involves disallowing unsafe file extensions to prevent potential attacks. The changes made in the codebase include modifications to handle unsafe extensions and sanitize them for safety.

The other CVE IDs mentioned (**CVE-2024-40631** or **CVE-2024-36043**) are not explicitly referenced or discussed in the provided context. Therefore, no information is available about those specific vulnerabilities based on the given details.
