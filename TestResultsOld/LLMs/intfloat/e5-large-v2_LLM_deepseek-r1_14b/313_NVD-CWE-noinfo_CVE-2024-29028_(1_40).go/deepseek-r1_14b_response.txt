Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the user's code has a vulnerability related to the provided CVE context. Let me start by understanding what the user provided and what the CVE entails.

The user shared a Go file with two functions: FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage. These functions handle HTTP GET requests for metadata extraction and image fetching, respectively. Both functions take a URL as a query parameter, validate it, and then use the httpGetter package to fetch data from that URL.

Looking at the retrieved CVE context, specifically CVE-2024-29028, it mentions an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability in memos version 0.13.2. The issue was at /o/get/httpmeta endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to enumerate internal networks and retrieve HTML values in JSON form. This was fixed by removing the httpmeta endpoint in version 0.16.1.

Now, I need to check if the user's code exhibits similar behavior that could lead to an SSRF. The key point is whether there's an endpoint that allows untrusted URLs to be used in making requests without proper validation.

In the user's code:

1. **FetchWebsiteMetadata**:
   - It parses the URL using `url.Parse`.
   - Uses `httpGetter.GetHTMLMeta` which I assume makes an HTTP request.
   - Returns the metadata as JSON.

2. **FetchImage**:
   - Similarly, it parses the URL and uses `httpGetter.GetImage`.

The vulnerability in memos was due to allowing arbitrary URLs without proper restrictions, leading to potential SSRF attacks. The fix involved removing that specific endpoint.

In the user's code, both endpoints are present (/get/httpmeta seems to have been removed as per the commit message). Wait, actually, looking at the provided Go file, there's an API route for /get/httpmeta in the changes section of the CVE context, which was deleted. But the user's current code has routes for /get/httpmeta (based on the commit) and perhaps others.

Wait, no—the user's code shows two endpoints: /get/httph meta and another for image fetching? No, looking at the user's provided code:

The functions are named FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage. The HTTP routes are:

- For FetchWebsiteMetadata: g.GET("/get/httpmeta", GetWebsiteMetadata)
- For FetchImage: It's not shown in the user's code snippet, but assuming it exists.

But according to the commit message, they removed the httpmeta endpoint by deleting lines 14-30. So if the user's current code doesn't have that route anymore, then perhaps the vulnerability is mitigated.

Wait, no—the user provided a different file, maybe? Let me clarify: The CVE context talks about removing lines in http_getter.go, which included the /get/httpmeta endpoint. But the user provided an http_getter.go file or another Go file?

Looking back, the user's code is from a file named "http_getter.go"? Or perhaps they shared a different part.

Wait, no, the user provided a different Go file, possibly their current implementation after the fix. Because in the changes for CVE-2024-29028, lines 14-30 were deleted, which included the httpmeta route and its function.

So if the user's code doesn't include those endpoints anymore, then they have fixed the issue. But looking at the user's provided code:

The functions are FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage. The HTTP routes in their code are:

- g.GET("/get/httpmeta", GetWebsiteMetadata) [but this was deleted]
Wait, no—the user's code shows:

In their code snippet, they have:

g.GET("/get/httph meta", GetWebsiteMetadata)

and another for image fetching.

But in the commit message, lines 14 and 15 were removed. So if the user's current code doesn't include those routes, then the vulnerability is fixed. But from the provided code, it's unclear whether they still have /get/httpmeta or not.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:

The CVE context says that in http_getter.go, lines 14-30 were deleted. Those lines included the HTTP route for "/get/httpmeta". So if the user's current code no longer has that route, then the vulnerability is fixed.

In the user's provided code, they have two functions: FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage, which are registered under different routes. From the function names, perhaps the endpoints are /get/httpmeta and another for image.

But in the commit message, lines 14-30 were deleted, meaning that the /get/httpmeta endpoint was removed. Therefore, if the user's code no longer has that route, then the vulnerability is not present.

Wait, but looking at the user's code, I see:

In the provided Go file, there are two functions: FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage. The HTTP routes for these functions would be defined elsewhere, possibly in a router setup.

But based on the commit message, they removed the lines that set up the /get/httpmeta route. So if the user's code doesn't have that endpoint anymore, then it's secure.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's code still has other endpoints that could be vulnerable.

Wait, but according to the provided code, the functions are named FetchWebsiteMetadata and FetchImage, which might correspond to different endpoints than /get/httpmeta. So if they removed that specific route, the vulnerability is gone.

Therefore, based on this analysis, since the user's code doesn't include the httpmeta endpoint anymore (as per the commit message), the vulnerability has been mitigated.
