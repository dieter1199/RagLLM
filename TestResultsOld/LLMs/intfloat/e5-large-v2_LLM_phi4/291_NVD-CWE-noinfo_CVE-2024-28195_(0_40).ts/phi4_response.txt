To determine if the provided code snippet has a vulnerability related to any of the CVEs mentioned (i.e., CVE-2024-32869, CVE-2024-35352, or CVE-2024-35609), let's analyze each CVE in relation to the snippet.

### Analysis:

1. **CVE-2024-32869:**
   - This vulnerability is related to Microsoft Azure DevOps Server and Services where an attacker could exploit a deserialization issue leading to code execution with elevated privileges.
   - The provided code does not involve any serialization or deserialization logic nor anything that resembles Azure DevOps functionality.

2. **CVE-2024-35352:**
   - This CVE pertains to Apache Flink's use of unsafe regex patterns, which could lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability due to potential catastrophic backtracking.
   - The provided code uses the `zod` library for schema validation and does not involve any regex pattern matching directly. Therefore, this vulnerability is unlikely to apply.

3. **CVE-2024-35609:**
   - This CVE involves an open redirect vulnerability in Express.js due to improper handling of URLs.
   - The provided code snippet uses `express.Router` but does not manipulate or set the 'Location' header nor handle external URLs directly that could lead to an open redirect.

### Conclusion:

The code snippet is primarily focused on validating query parameters and performing database searches for artists, tracks, and albums. It does not exhibit any of the behaviors associated with the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2024-32869, CVE-2024-35352, or CVE-2024-35609. Therefore, there is no relevant vulnerability from these CVEs found in the provided code.

**Answer: No vulnerability related to the mentioned CVEs is present in the code snippet.**
