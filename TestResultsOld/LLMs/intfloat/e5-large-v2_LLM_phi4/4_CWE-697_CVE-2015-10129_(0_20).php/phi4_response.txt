The provided PHP code snippet involves handling an authentication mechanism using cookies to store a password hash and redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page. Let's analyze the snippet in relation to the potential vulnerabilities mentioned in the top three CVE summaries:

1. **CVE-2024-25410** (Top-1): This vulnerability is related to insufficient session regeneration during privilege escalation attempts in an application. The code snippet does not involve any session handling or privilege management; it focuses solely on cookie-based authentication using a static password hash. Therefore, this CVE is not applicable.

2. **CVE-2024-24539** (Top-3): This vulnerability involves improper session validation in FusionPBX before version 5.2.0. The code snippet does not use PHP sessions; it relies entirely on cookies for authentication. Since there are no PHP sessions involved, this CVE is not relevant.

3. **CVE-2024-24539** (Top-3): This CVE also involves session handling issues but focuses on validating a session hash based on the user's IP address and user agent to prevent session hijacking. Again, since the snippet does not use sessions, this vulnerability is not applicable.

The code snippet has its own potential security issue: it uses a static password stored in a file (`pwd.inc.php`) for authentication via cookies. This approach can be insecure because:

- If an attacker gains access to `pwd.inc.php`, they could retrieve and misuse the password.
- Storing passwords in files is generally not recommended; using environment variables or secure vaults is preferable.
- The use of cookies without additional security measures (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags) can expose them to theft via XSS attacks.

However, none of these issues directly correspond to the CVEs provided. Therefore, based on the analysis:

**No vulnerability from the listed CVEs applies to this code snippet.**
