To determine if there's a relevant vulnerability in the provided code snippet related to any of the given CVEs, we need to analyze the context and content of the code against the described vulnerabilities:

### Context Analysis

The provided code is from `PDPSecurityInitiatorListener.h`, which seems to be part of Fast DDS (Data Distribution Service) for real-time systems. This file deals with a security listener in the discovery protocol used by RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe).

### Vulnerability Check Against Provided CVEs:

1. **CVE-2023-50257:**
   - **Description:** This vulnerability is related to a buffer overflow condition in `CDRMessage::writeData` due to an incorrect check on the length of `parameter.data`.
   - **Relevance:** The code snippet does not mention or involve any operations similar to writing data using CDR (Common Data Representation). It primarily deals with security listeners and participant discovery, without any apparent buffer manipulation functions like `CDRMessage::writeData`.

2. **CVE-2023-34462:**
   - **Description:** This involves an integer overflow in `ParameterSerializer::read` due to a multiplication on line 1042.
   - **Relevance:** The provided code does not include any operations related to parameter reading or serialization that would involve arithmetic operations leading to potential overflows.

3. **CVE-2024-24823:**
   - **Description:** This vulnerability is about an out-of-bounds read in `CDRMessage::readData` due to a comparison on line 889.
   - **Relevance:** Similar to the first CVE, this involves data reading operations with CDR messages. The provided code does not include such operations.

4. **CVE-2024-24824:**
   - **Description:** This is related to an integer overflow in `ParameterSerializer::write` due to a multiplication on line 1042.
   - **Relevance:** Again, the snippet does not involve parameter writing or serialization that could lead to such issues.

### Conclusion

The provided code snippet from `PDPSecurityInitiatorListener.h` does not seem to be related to any of the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The operations in the code are focused on security and participant discovery within a real-time communication protocol, without direct involvement in data serialization or buffer management that would relate to these specific vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the analysis, **no relevant vulnerability is found** in this code snippet with respect to the listed CVEs.
