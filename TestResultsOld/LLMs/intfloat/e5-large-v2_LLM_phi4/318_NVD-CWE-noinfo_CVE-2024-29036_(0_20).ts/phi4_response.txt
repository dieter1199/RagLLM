The code snippet you provided involves configuring an authentication client for Saleor using environment variables and specific storage mechanisms for tokens. The primary concern here is whether this configuration introduces or relates to a known vulnerability.

### Analysis:

1. **Code Context**:
   - The snippet imports functions from the `@saleor/auth-sdk` package.
   - It sets up an authentication client (`saleorAuthClient`) using environment variables and cookie storage for tokens.

2. **Potential Vulnerability**:
   - The code uses `accessTokenStorage` and `refreshTokenStorage` with `nextServerCookiesStorage`. This setup could be vulnerable if the cookies are not handled securely, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized access.

3. **Comparison with CVE-2024-29036**:
   - CVE-2024-29036 involves a vulnerability in Saleor where authentication tokens were stored insecurely, allowing potential unauthorized access.
   - The provided code snippet uses `nextServerCookiesStorage` for storing tokens, which is similar to the issue described in CVE-2024-29036.

### Conclusion:

Given the similarity in how tokens are stored and the context of CVE-2024-29036, it is likely that the configuration in your code snippet could be related to this vulnerability. The use of `nextServerCookiesStorage` for both access and refresh tokens without additional security measures aligns with the conditions described in the CVE.

**CVE ID**: CVE-2024-29036

To mitigate this risk, consider using secure storage mechanisms that protect against unauthorized access and ensure cookies are configured with appropriate security attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
