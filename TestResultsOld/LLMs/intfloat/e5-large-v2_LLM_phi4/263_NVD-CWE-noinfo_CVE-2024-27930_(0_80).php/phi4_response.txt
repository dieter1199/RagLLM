To determine if there's a potential security vulnerability related to CVE-2024-23645 in the provided PHP code, we need to analyze how user inputs are handled and validated. The primary concern with this type of issue often involves improper input validation or sanitization that can lead to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Arbitrary Code Execution.

### Analysis:

1. **User Input Handling:**
   - The code uses `$_POST` data extensively, including keys like `"idtable"`, `"name"`, `"value"`, `"entity_restrict"`, `"condition"`, `"used"`, and `"width"`.
   - Inputs such as `"idtable"` are used to dynamically determine the inclusion of a class (`class_exists($_POST["idtable"])`) which could lead to potential Arbitrary File Upload or Remote Code Execution if not properly validated.

2. **Input Validation:**
   - The code checks if `$_POST["idtable"]` exists and whether a corresponding class exists using `class_exists()`. This does provide some level of validation, but it might not be sufficient against all attack vectors.
   - There is no explicit whitelist or validation for the `"idtable"` input. A malicious user could potentially exploit this to pass arbitrary classes that might execute unintended code.

3. **Input Sanitization:**
   - The `Html::cleanId()` function is used to sanitize the field ID, which helps prevent some types of injection attacks.
   - However, sanitizing only the field ID does not address potential vulnerabilities related to other inputs like `"idtable"` or dynamic class inclusion.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - The use of `Session::getNewIDORToken()` suggests some form of CSRF protection for actions involving specific item types.
   - There is no explicit output encoding before rendering user input, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the inputs are echoed back in HTML without proper escaping.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the primary concern revolves around the dynamic inclusion and execution based on `$_POST["idtable"]`, which lacks stringent validation. This can potentially lead to Arbitrary Code Execution if an attacker manages to pass a class that executes unwanted code.

- **CVE-2024-23645:** This CVE ID is associated with vulnerabilities involving improper input validation leading to arbitrary code execution or similar issues. The lack of strict validation for the `"idtable"` parameter aligns with this type of vulnerability.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the PHP code does exhibit a potential vulnerability related to **CVE-2024-23645** due to insufficient validation of user inputs that determine dynamic class inclusion and execution.
