Based on the context provided, I would recommend investigating the possibility of a vulnerability in the npm package "react-toastify". The given commit message and code changes suggest that this package may be vulnerable to an SRI (SubResource Integrity) bypass attack.

It is important to note that without further context or information, it is not possible to determine the specific vulnerability or severity of the issue at hand. Therefore, I would recommend conducting a thorough security audit and testing the package's functionality in order to verify the presence of the vulnerability and assess its potential impact on your application.
