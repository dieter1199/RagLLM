Based on the provided context, we can see that there are multiple vulnerabilities identified in different files of the project. However, without further information about the specific issue you're facing or the code you're working with, it's difficult to provide a specific CVE ID for each vulnerability.

That being said, based on the general nature of the issues mentioned (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), I would recommend conducting further research and analysis to determine the most appropriate CVE ID for each vulnerability.

It's also worth noting that these CVE IDs are specific to a particular version of the affected software, so it's important to ensure that you're using the latest version available and that any updates or patches have been applied in order to address any known vulnerabilities.
