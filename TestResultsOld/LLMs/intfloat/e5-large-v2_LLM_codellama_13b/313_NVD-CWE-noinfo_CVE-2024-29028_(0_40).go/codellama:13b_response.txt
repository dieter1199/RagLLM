 Based on the information provided, it appears that the vulnerabilities identified by the GitHub Security Advisory were related to two separate issues:

1. A potential security vulnerability in the way the `vela` tool handles secret injection during pipeline execution (CVE-2024-29028). This vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary secrets into a running container, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.
2. A potential security vulnerability in the way the `vela` tool handles the injection of non-substituted secrets during pipeline execution (CVE-2024-29029). This vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary secrets into a running container, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.
3. A potential security vulnerability in the way the `vela` tool handles secret injection during pipeline execution (CVE-2024-28236). This vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary secrets into a running container, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.

It is important to note that the GitHub Security Advisory only identified potential vulnerabilities and did not provide any details on how to exploit them or whether the vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. It is also possible that these vulnerabilities may have already been fixed in the latest version of the `vela` tool.
