Based on the context provided, it seems like there are multiple potential vulnerabilities in different libraries with similar characteristics. However, without more information about the specific circumstances of your situation, it is difficult to determine which CVE ID (if any) applies.

If you have any additional details or context that may help identify a specific vulnerability, please provide them. Otherwise, I would recommend consulting with security experts or seeking guidance from reputable sources to better understand the potential risks and take appropriate action.
