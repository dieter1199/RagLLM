Based on the code changes provided, it appears that the vulnerability addressed is **CVE-2024-2213**.  

Here's why:

* **Mitigation Focus:** The code modifications clearly aim to restrict admin privileges by:
    * Setting `is_admin` to `False` as a default in many instances.
    * Adding checks to prevent removal of admin status for the default user.
    * Enforcing proper authorization when granting or modifying admin permissions.

These changes align with the typical fixes for vulnerabilities involving insecure management of administrative roles, which is consistent with CVE-2024-2213's description.
