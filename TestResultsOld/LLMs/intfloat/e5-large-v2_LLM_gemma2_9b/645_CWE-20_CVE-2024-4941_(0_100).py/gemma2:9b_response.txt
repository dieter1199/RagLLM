While the provided context describes changes made to code files, it doesn't explicitly mention a specific CVE ID (CVE-2024-4941, CVE-2024-2206, or CVE-2024-0964) or any vulnerability. 

The commit message mentions fixing API endpoint issues and potential security vulnerabilities.  However, without more information about the nature of these fixes and the original vulnerabilities, it's impossible to determine which CVE (if any) is related.


To get a definitive answer, you would need to:

* **Consult the full commit message:** It might provide more details about the fixed vulnerabilities.
* **Examine the code changes:**  Analyzing the specific lines of code modified could reveal clues about the vulnerability addressed.
* **Refer to a security advisory or bug report:** If this is a publicly disclosed vulnerability, there would likely be an official report detailing the CVE ID and affected software. 




Let me know if you have any other context that might help!
