Based on the provided information, it appears the code changes are aimed at mitigating a vulnerability.  The specific CVE ID is not mentioned in the text.

**Here's what we can infer:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** The changes focus on sanitizing user input related to 'entity_restrict'. This suggests the vulnerability likely involves SQL injection or similar code injection attacks.
* **Mitigation Technique:** The code now uses `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities($_POST['entity_restrict'])`  instead of directly using the user-provided value. This indicates a measure to validate and potentially sanitize the input before using it in queries.

**To determine the exact CVE ID, you would need to:**

* **Refer to official security advisories or vulnerability databases:** Search for vulnerabilities related to the software/system where this code resides.
* **Consult internal documentation or bug reports:** If this is an internal project, check for records mentioning the specific vulnerability and its resolution.
