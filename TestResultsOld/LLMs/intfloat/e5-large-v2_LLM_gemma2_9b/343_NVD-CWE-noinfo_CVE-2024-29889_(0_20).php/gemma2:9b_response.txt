The provided context describes changes made to a PHP codebase focusing on sanitizing user input for entity restrictions using the `Session::getMatchingActiveEntities()` function. This strongly suggests the mitigation of a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, which is often exploitable through manipulating "entity" parameters. 

**However, without access to the original vulnerable code or official CVE reports, it's impossible to definitively link these changes to a specific CVE ID like CVE-2024-23645, CVE-2024-27930, or CVE-2024-27937.**

**Here's why:**

* **CVE assignments are public:**  Official CVEs are published by organizations like MITRE. Without access to those databases or vulnerability reports, we can't confirm a match.
* **Code changes don't always equal specific CVE fixes:** While the changes clearly address potential XSS vectors, they might be part of broader security improvements unrelated to a publicly known CVE.


**To find the related CVE ID:**

1. **Contact the project maintainers:** They would have the best information about the code changes and any associated vulnerabilities.
2. **Search vulnerability databases:** Use resources like the MITRE CVE database (https://cve.mitre.org/) or security advisories from reputable sources to look for mentions of similar fixes in the affected software.
