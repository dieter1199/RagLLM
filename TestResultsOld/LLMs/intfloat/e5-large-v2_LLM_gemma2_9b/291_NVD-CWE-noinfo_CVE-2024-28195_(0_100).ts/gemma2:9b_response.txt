The provided information suggests a potential vulnerability fix related to random string generation and cryptographic functions within the codebase.  

**However, without more context about the specific vulnerabilities addressed in each file change and the original code, it is impossible to determine the exact CVE ID(s) involved.** 

The commit messages or other accompanying documentation would be crucial for identifying the specific vulnerabilities patched. 


Here's what we can infer:

* **Potentially Vulnerable Areas:** The changes focus on cryptographic functions (`crypto.ts`, `privateData.ts`) and random string generation (`crypto.ts`, `privateData.ts`). These areas are common targets for vulnerabilities like insecure random number generators or weak cryptographic implementations.
* **Mitigation Efforts:**  The code changes introduce stronger random number generation techniques using `getRandomValues` and  `subtle.digest`, potentially addressing weaknesses in previous implementations. 

**To find the exact CVE ID(s), you would need to:**

1. **Consult the project's issue tracker or commit history:** Look for commits related to security fixes and any mentions of CVE IDs.
2. **Examine the code diffs more closely:**  Look for comments or annotations that explicitly mention the vulnerabilities being addressed.
3. **Contact the project maintainers:** They would be the best source of information about the specific CVEs fixed in this update. 



Remember, security vulnerabilities are often complex and require careful analysis to understand their impact and remediation.
