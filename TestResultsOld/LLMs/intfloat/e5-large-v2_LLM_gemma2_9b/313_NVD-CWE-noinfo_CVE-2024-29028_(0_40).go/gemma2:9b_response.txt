The provided context describes security patches made to address vulnerabilities.  

**While it does not explicitly state the specific CVE ID(s) being fixed**, the pattern of changes suggests they are related to:

* **Secret injection:** The code modifications focus on handling and injecting secrets, especially "non-substituted secrets" for containers.
* **CVE-2024-28236:**  This vulnerability was about insecure secret handling in a container runtime environment, potentially allowing unauthorized access or data leaks. 

**Therefore, it is highly probable that the CVE IDs addressed in these changes are CVE-2024-28236.**


To confirm, you'd need to:

1. **Check commit messages:**  The code changes likely have accompanying commit messages that explicitly mention the fixed CVEs.
2. **Review security advisories:** The project maintaining this code might have released security advisories detailing patched vulnerabilities.
