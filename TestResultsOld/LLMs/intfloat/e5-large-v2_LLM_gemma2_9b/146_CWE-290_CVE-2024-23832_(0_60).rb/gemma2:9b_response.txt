Based on the provided code changes, it appears the vulnerability is **CVE-2024-32983**.  

Here's why:

* **Changes Indicate Mitigation:** The extensive code modifications across various files suggest a focused effort to address a specific security issue. 
* **Fetching Remote Data with `id: true`:**  The numerous instances where the parameter `id: true` is removed from calls to services like `ActivityPub::FetchRemoteAccountService`, `ActivityPub::FetchRemoteKeyService` strongly point towards mitigating a vulnerability related to insecure data fetching. 

**Potential Explanation:**

CVE-2024-32983 likely involved an attacker exploiting the potential for retrieving sensitive information (like account details or private keys) without proper identification verification when `id: true` was used. By removing this parameter, the developers aim to prevent unauthorized access to such sensitive data.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific code change or aspect of the mitigation strategy!
