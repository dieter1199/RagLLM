The retrieved CVE ID is **CVE-2024-37298**.

**Related info:**

* **Vulnerability description:** gorilla/schema converts structs to and from form values. Prior to version 1.4.1, running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations.
* **Patch information:** Version 1.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.
* **Changes:** The patch included adding a configurable `MaxSize` parameter to the decoder, which limits the size of slices created based on user input.
* **Vulnerable code:** The vulnerable code is in the `decoder.go` file, where it allows users to create large slices based on user input indices.
* **Mitigation:** The mitigation is to set a maximum size for slices using the `MaxSize()` function.
