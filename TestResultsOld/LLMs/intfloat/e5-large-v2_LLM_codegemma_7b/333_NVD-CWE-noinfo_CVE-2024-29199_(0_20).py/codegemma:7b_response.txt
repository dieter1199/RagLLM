**CVE-2024-34707**

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Nautobot

**Description:**
The Nautobot web application is vulnerable to XSS due to improper sanitization of user input. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application via crafted HTML or JavaScript content, which can allow them to steal sensitive data, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement input sanitization measures to prevent malicious code injection.
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of JavaScript in the browser.
- Regularly update Nautobot to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
