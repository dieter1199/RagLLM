That will result in multiple forked children producing repeat (or similar) results. This affects HHVM 3.26 prior to 3.26.3 and the folly library between v2017.12.11.00 and v2018.08.09.00.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
