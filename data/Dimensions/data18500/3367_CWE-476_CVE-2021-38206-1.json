    "commit_message": "mac80211: Fix NULL ptr deref for injected rate info\n\nThe commit cb17ed29a7a5 (\"mac80211: parse radiotap header when selecting Tx\nqueue\") moved the code to validate the radiotap header from\nieee80211_monitor_start_xmit to ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap. This made is\npossible to share more code with the new Tx queue selection code for\ninjected frames. But at the same time, it now required the call of\nieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap at the beginning of functions which wanted to\nhandle the radiotap header. And this broke the rate parser for radiotap\nheader parser.\n\nThe radiotap parser for rates is operating most of the time only on the\ndata in the actual radiotap header. But for the 802.11a/b/g rates, it must\nalso know the selected band from the chandef information. But this\ninformation is only written to the ieee80211_tx_info at the end of the\nieee80211_monitor_start_xmit - long after ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap was\nalready called. The info->band information was therefore always 0\n(NL80211_BAND_2GHZ) when the parser code tried to access it.\n\nFor a 5GHz only device, injecting a frame with 802.11a rates would cause a\nNULL pointer dereference because local->hw.wiphy->bands[NL80211_BAND_2GHZ]\nwould most likely have been NULL when the radiotap parser searched for the\ncorrect rate index of the driver.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReported-by: Ben Greear <greearb@candelatech.com>\nFixes: cb17ed29a7a5 (\"mac80211: parse radiotap header when selecting Tx queue\")\nSigned-off-by: Mathy Vanhoef <Mathy.Vanhoef@kuleuven.be>\n[sven@narfation.org: added commit message]\nSigned-off-by: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210530133226.40587-1-sven@narfation.org\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
