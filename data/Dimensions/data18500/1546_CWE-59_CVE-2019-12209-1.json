    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-12209",
    "cve_description": "Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')",
    "cwe_description": "The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.",
    "commit_message": "Drop privileges by default when opening user-related files\n\nThe module is typically executed as root and would sometimes\nopen files or follow symlinks that could be controlled from the\noutside.\n\nDrop privileges to the target user before opening any files.\n\nFixes CVE-2019-12209.\n\nThanks to Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE Security Team for reporting\nthe issue.",
