    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.",
    "commit_message": "Remove all disallowed SVG element attributes\n\nIn a further attempt to reduce remote code injection attack vectors, all attributes except for a set of allowed standard attributes are removed from the SVG element before being converted. Deprecated attributes are included by default, however, these can also be removed by disabling the new `allowDeprecatedAttributes` option.",
