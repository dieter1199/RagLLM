This means that one can\ndo arbitrary HTTP GET requests from the server itself. This doesn't work\nin the browser context because of the restrictive CSP policy, which is\nnot applied during the pdf generation.\n\nThis is a MINOR vulnerability as other security measures in the PHP\nconfiguration prevents prospective escalation.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by @mgrRaf and @xoffense. Thank to them\nfor responsible disclosure. A bounty has been awarded.",
