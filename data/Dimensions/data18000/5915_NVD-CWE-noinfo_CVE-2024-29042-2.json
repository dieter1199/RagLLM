    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-29042",
    "cve_description": "Translate is a package that allows users to convert text to different languages on Node.js and the browser. Prior to version 3.0.0, an attacker controlling the second variable of the `translate` function is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id` parameter allows the overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue.",
