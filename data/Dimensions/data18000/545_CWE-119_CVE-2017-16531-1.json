    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "USB: fix out-of-bounds in usb_set_configuration\n\nAndrey Konovalov reported a possible out-of-bounds problem for a USB interface\nassociation descriptor.  He writes:\n\tIt seems there's no proper size check of a USB_DT_INTERFACE_ASSOCIATION\n\tdescriptor. It's only checked that the size is >= 2 in\n\tusb_parse_configuration(), so find_iad() might do out-of-bounds access\n\tto intf_assoc->bInterfaceCount.\n\nAnd he's right, we don't check for crazy descriptors of this type very well, so\nresolve this problem.
