    "cwe_name": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
    "commit_message": "libvncserver: scale: cast to 64 bit before shifting\n\nSince pixel_value is 64 bit the data type of the shift operand should\nbe 64 bit too to prevent integer overflows.",
