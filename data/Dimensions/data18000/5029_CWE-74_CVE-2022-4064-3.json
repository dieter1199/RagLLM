    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.",
    "commit_message": "Fixes #932 (#933)\n\nDo some input sanitization for the meta protocol. Since this protocol uses raw test, it is possible to execute an injection attack against unsanitized inputs.\r\n\r\nThis commit explicitly sanitizes the CAS arguments and the ttl passed to flush.\r\n\r\nI also added some missing tests for meta_arithmetic and fixed a few lints.",
