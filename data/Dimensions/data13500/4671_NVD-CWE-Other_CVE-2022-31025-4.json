    "cve_description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and 2.9.0beta5 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, inviting users on sites that use single sign-on could bypass the `must_approve_users` check and invites by staff are always approved automatically. The issue is patched in Discourse version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, disable invites or increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.",

    "commit_message": "SECURITY: Remove auto approval when redeeming an invite (#16974)\n\nThis security fix affects sites which have `SiteSetting.must_approve_users`\r\nenabled. There are intentional and unintentional cases where invited\r\nusers can be auto approved and are deemed to have skipped the staff approval process.\r\nInstead of trying to reason about when auto-approval should happen, we have decided that\r\nenabling the `must_approve_users` setting going forward will just mean that all new users\r\nmust be explicitly approved by a staff user in the review queue. The only case where users are auto\r\napproved is when the `auto_approve_email_domains` site setting is used.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alan Guo Xiang Tan <gxtan1990@gmail.com>",
