    "cve_description": "eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue.",

This causes a heap buffer overflow error. A comparison statement was inserted before the line that calculates the variable, which fixes the error.\n\nSigned-off-by: Desglaneurs <cveissacgleaning@gmail.com>\n\n* Refs #20549: Fix review\n\nSigned-off-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>\n\n* Refs #201549: Reset the change data fields before exiting\n\nSigned-off-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>\nSigned-off-by: Desglaneurs <cveissacgleaning@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Mario Dominguez <mariodominguez@eprosima.com>",
