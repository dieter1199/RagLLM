    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-23568",
    "cve_description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` is vulnerable to an integer overflow which results in a `CHECK`-fail when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, an assert failure based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-190",
    "cwe_name": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
    "commit_message": "Add missing validation to `AddManySparseToTensorsMap`.\n\nSparse tensors have a set of requirements for the 3 components and not all of them were checked.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 415358027\nChange-Id: I96cbb672999cd1da772c22fabbd15507e32e12dc",
