    "cve_description": "PeterO.Cbor versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0 are vulnerable to a denial of \nservice vulnerability. An attacker may trigger the denial of service \ncondition by providing crafted data to the DecodeFromBytes or other \ndecoding mechanisms in PeterO.Cbor. Depending on the usage of the \nlibrary, an unauthenticated and remote attacker may be able to cause the\n denial of service condition.\n",
