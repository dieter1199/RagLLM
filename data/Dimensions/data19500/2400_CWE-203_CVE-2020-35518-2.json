    "commit_message": "Issue 4609 - CVE - info disclosure when authenticating\n\nDescription:  If you bind as a user that does not exist.  Error 49 is returned\n              instead of error 32.  As error 32 discloses that the entry does\n              not exist.  When you bind as an entry that does not have userpassword\n              set then error 48 (inappropriate auth) is returned, but this\n              discloses that the entry does indeed exist.  Instead we should\n              always return error 49, even if the password is not set in the\n              entry.  This way we do not disclose to an attacker if the Bind\n              DN exists or not.\n\nRelates: https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/4609\n\nReviewed by: tbordaz(Thanks!)",
