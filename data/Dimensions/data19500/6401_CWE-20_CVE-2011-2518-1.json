    "cve_description": "The tomoyo_mount_acl function in security/tomoyo/mount.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39.2 calls the kern_path function with arguments taken directly from a mount system call, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a NULL value for the device name.",

    "commit_message": "TOMOYO: Fix oops in tomoyo_mount_acl().\n\nIn tomoyo_mount_acl() since 2.6.36, kern_path() was called without checking\ndev_name != NULL. As a result, an unprivileged user can trigger oops by issuing\nmount(NULL, \"/\", \"ext3\", 0, NULL) request.\nFix this by checking dev_name != NULL before calling kern_path(dev_name).\n\nSigned-off-by: Tetsuo Handa <penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp>\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: James Morris <jmorris@namei.org>",
