    "commit_message": "CVE-2017-13003/Clean up the LMP dissector.\n\nDo a lot more bounds and length checks.\n\nAdd a EXTRACT_8BITS() macro, for completeness, and so as not to confuse\npeople into thinking that, to fetch a 1-byte value from a packet, they\nneed to use EXTRACT_16BITS() to fetch a 2-byte value and then use\nshifting and masking to extract the desired byte.  Use that rather than\nusing EXTRACT_16BITS() to fetch a 2-byte value and then shifting and\nmasking to extract the desired byte.\n\nDon't treat IPv4 addresses and unnumbered interface IDs the same; the\nfirst should be printed as an IPv4 address but the latter should just be\nprinted as numbers.  Handle IPv6 addresses in more object types while\nwe're at it.\n\nThis fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Forcepoint's security\nresearchers Otto Airamo & Antti Levom√§ki.\n\nAdd a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).",
