    "cve_description": "The (1) IPv4 and (2) IPv6 implementations in the Linux kernel before 3.1 use a modified MD4 algorithm to generate sequence numbers and Fragment Identification values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disrupted networking) or hijack network sessions by predicting these values and sending crafted packets.",

    "cwe_name": "Other",
    "cwe_description": "NVD is only using a subset of CWE for mapping instead of the entire CWE, and the weakness type is not covered by that subset.",
    "commit_message": "net: Compute protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs using MD5.\n\nComputers have become a lot faster since we compromised on the\npartial MD4 hash which we use currently for performance reasons.\n\nMD5 is a much safer choice, and is inline with both RFC1948 and\nother ISS generators (OpenBSD, Solaris, etc.)\n\nFurthermore, only having 24-bits of the sequence number be truly\nunpredictable is a very serious limitation.  So the periodic\nregeneration and 8-bit counter have been removed.  We compute and\nuse a full 32-bit sequence number.\n\nFor ipv6, DCCP was found to use a 32-bit truncated initial sequence\nnumber (it needs 43-bits) and that is fixed here as well.\n\nReported-by: Dan Kaminsky <dan@doxpara.com>\nTested-by: Willy Tarreau <w@1wt.eu>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
