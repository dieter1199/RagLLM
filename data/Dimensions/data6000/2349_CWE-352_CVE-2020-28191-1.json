    "commit_message": "Added CSRF protection to the togglz console via a CSRF token passed between the server and the clinet. This remediates the vulnerabilty CVE-2020-28191 by blocking CSRF attacks as the attcker will not be able to guess the CSRF token value. (#495)\n\nThis has been implemented with either the session timeout of the application the togglz console is embedded in. Or if no user session is available it defaults to a 10 minute timeout for the CSRF token.\r\nThis CSRF token does not interfere with either OWASP's CSRFGuard or Spring-Security's CSRF protection if they are used within the application.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Joseph Beeton <joseph.p.beeton1@aexp.com>",
