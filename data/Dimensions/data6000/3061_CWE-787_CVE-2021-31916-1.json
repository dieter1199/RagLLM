    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-31916",
    "cve_description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",

    "commit_message": "dm ioctl: fix out of bounds array access when no devices\n\nIf there are not any dm devices, we need to zero the \"dev\" argument in\nthe first structure dm_name_list. However, this can cause out of\nbounds write, because the \"needed\" variable is zero and len may be\nless than eight.\n\nFix this bug by reporting DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG if the result buffer is\ntoo small to hold the \"nl->dev\" value.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>\nReported-by: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>",
