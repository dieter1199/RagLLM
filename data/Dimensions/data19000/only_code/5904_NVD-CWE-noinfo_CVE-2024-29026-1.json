// The following line is kind of a work around.
// If you want HTTP Basic Auth + Cors it requires _explicit_ origins to be provided in the
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.  So we just pull out the origin header and specify it.
// If we want to lock down admin APIs to not be CORS accessible for anywhere, this is where we would do that.
w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", r.Header.Get("Origin"))
