    "cve_description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. A security issue was discovered affecting parsing of the RPC result of the exit reason in case of EVM reversion. In release build, this would cause the exit reason being incorrectly parsed and returned by RPC. In debug build, this would cause an overflow panic. No action is needed unless you have a bridge node that needs to distinguish different reversion exit reasons and you used RPC for this. There are currently no known workarounds.",

    "cwe_name": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
