    "cwe_description": "Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control.",
    "commit_message": "proc: restrict access to /proc/PID/io\n\n/proc/PID/io may be used for gathering private information.  E.g.  for\nopenssh and vsftpd daemons wchars/rchars may be used to learn the\nprecise password length.  Restrict it to processes being able to ptrace\nthe target process.\n\nptrace_may_access() is needed to prevent keeping open file descriptor of\n\"io\" file, executing setuid binary and gathering io information of the\nsetuid'ed process.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vasiliy Kulikov <segoon@openwall.com>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
