// We store a weak session in localStorage, if 3rd party cookies disabled.
// It's fairly ok to use localStorage in our case, see:
//   ../../docs/session-in-local-storage.md
// [NOCOOKIES] [weaksid] ADD_TO_DOCS The session is (will be) "weak", in
// the sense that, even if you're admin, you cannot use it to go to the admin area
// and do things there. Then instead you need to login directly to the Talkyard
// server, rather than on the embedding site via the iframe â€” so an XSS
// vulnerability on the embedding site (the blog) cannot give admin access.
theStorage.setItem('talkyardSession', JSON.stringify(item));
