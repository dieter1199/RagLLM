    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-41249",
    "cve_description": "GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.",

    "commit_message": "Merge pull request from GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7\n\nThis change fixes an XSS vulnerability that has been present since the first\ncommit of GraphQL Playground when used with an untrusted GraphQL server. It applies three\nstrategies to fix via defense-in-depth: HTML escaping a string in a context\nthat uses innerHTML; validating incoming schemas with graphql-js validateSchema;\nand using a single up-to-date Markdown library.\n\nSee docs/security/2021-introspection-schema-xss.md for more details.",
