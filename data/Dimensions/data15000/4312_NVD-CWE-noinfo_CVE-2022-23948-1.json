    "commit_message": "secure_mount: add umount function\n\nThe `mount` function is called several times in different places in the\ncode, but it takes care of not mounting the secure directory if is\nalready present.  The problem is that this is never umounted.\n\nThis patch add the `umount` function, and update the `mount` one to\ntrack when a mount point needs to be umounted.\n\nAlso adjust the keylime_agent exit point to make sure that the `umount`\nfunction is called at the end.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alberto Planas <aplanas@suse.com>",
