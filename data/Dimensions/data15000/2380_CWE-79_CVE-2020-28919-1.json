    "commit_message": "Prevent non http/https links from being unescaped\n\nOur permissive HTML escaping is preserving some HTML tags, which includes basic\nlink tags (a tag with href and optional target attributes). Previous versions\nwere not inspecting the value of href, which made it possible to add links with\ne.g. a \"javascript:\" protocol. This opened some XSS attack vectors.\n\nAfter this change it is only possible to link to http and https protocols. All\nother links will not be unescaped.\n\nChange-Id: I6e029ecc52f3dd3fc1f213c7f809332e3e49b3ee",
