    "cve_description": "There are multiple unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerabilities in different FTP commands in uftpd FTP server versions 2.7 to 2.10 due to improper implementation of a chroot jail in common.c's compose_abspath function that can be abused to read or write to arbitrary files on the filesystem, leak process memory, or potentially lead to remote code execution.",

    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
