    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11565",
    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.”",

However,\nMPOL_PREFERRED requires a single node number, which is not being provided\nhere.\n\nAdd a check that 'nodes' is not empty after parsing for MPOL_PREFERRED's\nnodeid.\n\nFixes: 095f1fc4ebf3 (\"mempolicy: rework shmem mpol parsing and display\")\nReported-by: Entropy Moe <3ntr0py1337@gmail.com>\nReported-by: syzbot+b055b1a6b2b958707a21@syzkaller.appspotmail.com\nSigned-off-by: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@infradead.org>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nTested-by: syzbot+b055b1a6b2b958707a21@syzkaller.appspotmail.com\nCc: Lee Schermerhorn <lee.schermerhorn@hp.com>\nLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/89526377-7eb6-b662-e1d8-4430928abde9@infradead.org\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
