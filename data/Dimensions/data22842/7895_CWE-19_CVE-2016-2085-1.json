    "commit_message": "EVM: Use crypto_memneq() for digest comparisons\n\nThis patch fixes vulnerability CVE-2016-2085.  The problem exists\nbecause the vm_verify_hmac() function includes a use of memcmp().\nUnfortunately, this allows timing side channel attacks; specifically\na MAC forgery complexity drop from 2^128 to 2^12.  This patch changes\nthe memcmp() to the cryptographically safe crypto_memneq().\n\nReported-by: Xiaofei Rex Guo <xiaofei.rex.guo@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ryan Ware <ware@linux.intel.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: James Morris <james.l.morris@oracle.com>",
