* If {@link \phpseclib\Crypt\AES::setKeyLength() setKeyLength()} isn't called, it'll be calculated from
* {@link \phpseclib\Crypt\AES::setKey() setKey()}.  ie. if the key is 128-bits, the key length will be 128-bits.  If it's 136-bits
* it'll be null-padded to 192-bits and 192 bits will be the key length until {@link \phpseclib\Crypt\AES::setKey() setKey()}
* make a whole lot of sense.  {@link \phpseclib\Crypt\AES::setBlockLength() setBlockLength()}, for instance.  Calling that function,
* @param Integer $length
* @param Integer $length
* @param String $key
