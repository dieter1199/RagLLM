    "commit_message": "mnt: Only change user settable mount flags in remount\n\nKenton Varda <kenton@sandstorm.io> discovered that by remounting a\nread-only bind mount read-only in a user namespace the\nMNT_LOCK_READONLY bit would be cleared, allowing an unprivileged user\nto the remount a read-only mount read-write.\n\nCorrect this by replacing the mask of mount flags to preserve\nwith a mask of mount flags that may be changed, and preserve\nall others.   This ensures that any future bugs with this mask and\nremount will fail in an easy to detect way where new mount flags\nsimply won't change.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nAcked-by: Serge E.
