    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
    "commit_message": "Fixed the Zip Slip vulnerability in JlCompress\n\nWhen extracting a file with a dangerous path like \"../evil.exe\"\nfrom a ZIP archive with JlCompress::extractDir(), the target\nfile would be created outside of the target directory, potentially\neven overwriting an existing file there.",
