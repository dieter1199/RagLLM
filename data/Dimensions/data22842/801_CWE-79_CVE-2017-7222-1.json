    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-7222",
    "cve_description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MantisBT before 2.1.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript (if MantisBT's CSP settings permit it) by modifying 'window_title' in the application configuration. This requires privileged access to MantisBT configuration management pages (i.e., administrator access rights) or altering the system configuration file (config_inc.php).",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",
    "commit_message": "Sanitize window title\n\nThe window title is not sanitized.  That is not an issue when CSP is enable (default),\nbut if disabled, it can execute javascript that is set by a user who has access\nto set configuration via Manage - Manage Configuration - Configuration Report page.\n\nFixes #22266",
