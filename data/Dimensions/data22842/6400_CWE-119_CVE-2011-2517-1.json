    "cve_description": "Multiple buffer overflows in net/wireless/nl80211.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39.2 allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability during scan operations with a long SSID value.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "nl80211: fix check for valid SSID size in scan operations\n\nIn both trigger_scan and sched_scan operations, we were checking for\nthe SSID length before assigning the value correctly.  Since the\nmemory was just kzalloc'ed, the check was always failing and SSID with\nover 32 characters were allowed to go through.\n\nThis was causing a buffer overflow when copying the actual SSID to the\nproper place.\n\nThis bug has been there since 2.6.29-rc4.\n\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Luciano Coelho <coelho@ti.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
