    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-2315",
    "cve_description": "revision.c in git before 2.7.4 uses an incorrect integer data type, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a (1) long filename or (2) many nested trees, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-119",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "prefer memcpy to strcpy\n\nWhen we already know the length of a string (e.g., because\nwe just malloc'd to fit it), it's nicer to use memcpy than\nstrcpy, as it makes it more obvious that we are not going to\noverflow the buffer (because the size we pass matches the\nsize in the allocation).\n\nThis also eliminates calls to strcpy, which make auditing\nthe code base harder.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>\nSigned-off-by: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>",
