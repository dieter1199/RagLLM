This is a\nnice feature but it could be problematic when it's completely\nunlimited.  Most clearly it's illustrated with quines:\n\n$ curl -sRO http://www.maximumcompression.com/selfgz.gz\n$ (ulimit -v 10000000 && bsdtar -tvf selfgz.gz)\nbsdtar: Error opening archive: Can't allocate data for gzip decompression\n\nWithout ulimit, bsdtar will eat all available memory. This could also\nbe a problem for other applications using libarchive.",
