    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "crypto: ccm - move cbcmac input off the stack\n\nCommit f15f05b0a5de (\"crypto: ccm - switch to separate cbcmac driver\")\nrefactored the CCM driver to allow separate implementations of the\nunderlying MAC to be provided by a platform. However, in doing so, it\nmoved some data from the linear region to the stack, which violates the\nSG constraints when the stack is virtually mapped.\n\nSo move idata/odata back to the request ctx struct, of which we can\nreasonably expect that it has been allocated using kmalloc() et al.\n\nReported-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nFixes: f15f05b0a5de (\"crypto: ccm - switch to separate cbcmac driver\")\nSigned-off-by: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>\nTested-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>",
