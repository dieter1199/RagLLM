    "cve_description": "The ourWriteOut function in tool_writeout.c in curl 7.53.1 might allow physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory in opportunistic circumstances by reading a workstation screen during use of a --write-out argument ending in a '%' character, which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "tool_writeout: fixed a buffer read overrun on --write-out\n\nIf a % ended the statement, the string's trailing NUL would be skipped\nand memory past the end of the buffer would be accessed and potentially\ndisplayed as part of the --write-out output. Added tests 1440 and 1441\nto check for this kind of condition.\n\nReported-by: Brian Carpenter",
