    "cve_description": "The net/http library in net/textproto/reader.go in Go before 1.4.3 does not properly parse HTTP header keys, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a space instead of a hyphen, as demonstrated by \"Content Length\" instead of \"Content-Length.\"",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-444",
    "cwe_name": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')",
    "cwe_description": "The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.",
    "commit_message": "net/textproto: don't treat spaces as hyphens in header keys\n\nThis was originally done in https://codereview.appspot.com/5690059\n(Feb 2012) to deal with bad response headers coming back from webcams,\nbut it presents a potential security problem with HTTP request\nsmuggling for request headers containing \"Content Length\" instead of\n\"Content-Length\".\n\nPart of overall HTTP hardening for request smuggling. See RFC 7230.\n\nThanks to Régis Leroy for the report.\n\nChange-Id: I92b17fb637c9171c5774ea1437979ae2c17ca88a\nReviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/11772\nReviewed-by: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>\nRun-TryBot: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>\nTryBot-Result: Gobot Gobot <gobot@golang.org>",
