    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-9378",
    "cve_description": "BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 does not prevent a user from deleting their own account. This could have security relevance because deletion was supposed to be an admin-only action, and the admin may have other tasks (such as data backups) to complete before a user is deleted.",
    "cve_publish_date": "2017-06-02",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-863",
    "cwe_name": "Incorrect Authorization",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.",
    "commit_message": "Fixed a user potentially being able to delete themselves if they really really wanted to.\nhttps://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/282",
