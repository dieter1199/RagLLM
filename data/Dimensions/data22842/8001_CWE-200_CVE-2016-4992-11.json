If it is not allowed to access the subtree,\n   it returns INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS instead of NO_SUC_OBJECT.  Plus,\n   it supresses the \"Matched\" ancestor message.\n3) NO_SUCH_OBJECT in search -- If a bind entry has no rights to read\n   a subtree, it returns no search results with SUCCESS.  It should\n   be applied to the no existing subtree if the bind entry has no\n   rights to the super tree.\n4) If bind fails because of the non-existence of the bind user or\n   the parent nodes, the bind returns LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS to\n   the client with no other information.\n   The detailed cause is logged in the access log as follows:\n\t RESULT err=49 .. etime=0 - No such suffix (<given suffix>)\n\t RESULT err=49 .. etime=0 - Invalid credentials\n\t RESULT err=49 .. etime=0 - No such entry\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1347760\n\nReviewed by lkrispen@redhat.com, mreynolds@redhat.com, and tbordaz@redhat.com.\nThank you!!!",
