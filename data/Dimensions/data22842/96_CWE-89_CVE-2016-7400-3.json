    "cve_description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Exponent CMS before 2.4.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) id parameter in an activate_address address controller action, (2) title parameter in a show blog controller action, or (3) content_id parameter in a showComments expComment controller action.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
