    "cve_description": "The g2m_init_buffers function in libavcodec/g2meet.c in FFmpeg before 2.1 does not properly allocate memory for tiles, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Go2Webinar data.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-119",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "avcodec/g2meet: Fix framebuf size\n\nCurrently the code can in some cases draw tiles that hang outside the\nallocated buffer. This patch increases the buffer size to avoid out\nof array accesses. An alternative would be to fail if such tiles are\nencountered.\nI do not know if any valid files use such hanging tiles.\n\nFixes Ticket2971\nFound-by: ami_stuff\nSigned-off-by: Michael Niedermayer <michaelni@gmx.at>",
