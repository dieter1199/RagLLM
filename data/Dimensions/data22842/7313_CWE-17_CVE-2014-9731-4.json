This isn't as easy as just\nchecking the symlink size because of various encoding conversions we\nperform on path. So we have to check whether there is still enough space\nin the buffer on the fly.\n\nCC: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReported-by: Carl Henrik Lunde <chlunde@ping.uio.no>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>",
