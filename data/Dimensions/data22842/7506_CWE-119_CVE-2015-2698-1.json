    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "Fix IAKERB context export/import [CVE-2015-2698]\n\nThe patches for CVE-2015-2696 contained a regression in the newly\nadded IAKERB iakerb_gss_export_sec_context() function, which could\ncause it to corrupt memory.  Fix the regression by properly\ndereferencing the context_handle pointer before casting it.\n\nAlso, the patches did not implement an IAKERB gss_import_sec_context()\nfunction, under the erroneous belief that an exported IAKERB context\nwould be tagged as a krb5 context.  Implement it now to allow IAKERB\ncontexts to be successfully exported and imported after establishment.\n\nCVE-2015-2698:\n\nIn any MIT krb5 release with the patches for CVE-2015-2696 applied, an\napplication which calls gss_export_sec_context() may experience memory\ncorruption if the context was established using the IAKERB mechanism.\nHistorically, some vulnerabilities of this nature can be translated\ninto remote code execution, though the necessary exploits must be\ntailored to the individual application and are usually quite\ncomplicated.\n\n    CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C\n\nticket: 8273 (new)\ntarget_version: 1.14\ntags: pullup",
