    "commit_message": "Fix a XSS vulnerability with bad input to json_dumps.\n\nDjango's JSON serialization does not handle escaping of any characters\nto make them safe for injecting into HTML. This allows an attacker who\ncan provide part of a JSON-serializable object to craft a string that\ncan break out of a <script> tag and create its own, injecting a custom\nscript.\n\nTo fix this, we escape '<', '>', and '&' characters in the resulting\nstring, preventing a </script> from executing.",
