    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "Fix possible stack overflows in decoder for illegal bit streams\n\nFixes CVE-2018-0429\nA vulnerability in the Thor decoder (available at:\nhttps://github.com/cisco/thor) could allow an authenticated, local\nattacker to cause segmentation faults and stack overflows when using a\nnon-conformant Thor bitstream as input.\nThe vulnerability is due to lack of input validation when parsing the\nbitstream. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a\nstack overflow and potentially inject and execute arbitrary code.",
