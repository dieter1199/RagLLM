    "cve_description": "The atl2_probe function in drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atlx/atl2.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by reading packet data.",

    "cwe_description": "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.",
    "commit_message": "atl2: Disable unimplemented scatter/gather feature\n\natl2 includes NETIF_F_SG in hw_features even though it has no support\nfor non-linear skbs.  This bug was originally harmless since the\ndriver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to\nbe a requirement for SG.\n\nNow that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you\nexplicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use\nSG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive\ninformation (before you notice that it just isn't working).  Therefore\nthis obscure bug has been designated CVE-2016-2117.\n\nReported-by: Justin Yackoski <jyackoski@crypto-nite.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>\nFixes: ec5f06156423 (\"net: Kill link between CSUM and SG features.\")\nSigned-off-by: David S.
