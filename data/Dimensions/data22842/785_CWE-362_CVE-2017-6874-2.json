    "cve_description": "Race condition in kernel/ucount.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls that leverage certain decrement behavior that causes incorrect interaction between put_ucounts and get_ucounts.",

    "cwe_name": "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')",
    "cwe_description": "The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.",
    "commit_message": "ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count\n\nAlways increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts_lock.  The\nincrements are there already and moving the decrements there means the\nlocking logic of the code is simpler.  This simplification in the\nlocking logic fixes a race between put_ucounts and get_ucounts that\ncould result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then\nbe found by get_ucounts and then be freed by put_ucounts.\n\nA bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and\nKASAN.  JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov\nspotted the race in the code.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nFixes: f6b2db1a3e8d (\"userns: Make the count of user namespaces per user\")\nReported-by: JongHwan Kim <zzoru007@gmail.com>\nReported-by: Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Andrei Vagin <avagin@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: \"Eric W.
