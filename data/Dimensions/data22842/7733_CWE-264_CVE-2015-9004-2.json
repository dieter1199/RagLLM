    "commit_message": "perf: Tighten (and fix) the grouping condition\n\nThe fix from 9fc81d87420d (\"perf: Fix events installation during\nmoving group\") was incomplete in that it failed to recognise that\ncreating a group with events for different CPUs is semantically\nbroken -- they cannot be co-scheduled.\n\nFurthermore, it leads to real breakage where, when we create an event\nfor CPU Y and then migrate it to form a group on CPU X, the code gets\nconfused where the counter is programmed -- triggered in practice\nas well by me via the perf fuzzer.\n\nFix this by tightening the rules for creating groups. Only allow\ngrouping of counters that can be co-scheduled in the same context.\nThis means for the same task and/or the same cpu.\n\nFixes: 9fc81d87420d (\"perf: Fix events installation during moving group\")\nSigned-off-by: Peter Zijlstra (Intel) <peterz@infradead.org>\nCc: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@kernel.org>\nCc: Jiri Olsa <jolsa@redhat.com>\nCc: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>\nLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20150123125834.090683288@infradead.org\nSigned-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>",
