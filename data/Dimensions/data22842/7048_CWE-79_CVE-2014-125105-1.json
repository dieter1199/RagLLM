    "commit_message": "Fixed an XSS vulnerability on the link checker settings page. Two input fields were not properly escaped, which would allow a malicious admin-level user to insert arbitrary HTML/JS into the page.\n\nAlso fixed certain special characters being prefixed with slashes after saving settings. This was caused by WordPress automatically applying \"magic quotes\" (as in the deprecated PHP \"feature\") to all POST fields.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/broken-link-checker/trunk@1038180 b8457f37-d9ea-0310-8a92-e5e31aec5664",
