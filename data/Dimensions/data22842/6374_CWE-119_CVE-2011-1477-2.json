    "cve_description": "Multiple array index errors in sound/oss/opl3.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 allow local users to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging write access to /dev/sequencer.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
