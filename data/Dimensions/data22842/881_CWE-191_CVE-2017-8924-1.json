    "cve_description": "The edge_bulk_in_callback function in drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.4 allows local users to obtain sensitive information (in the dmesg ringbuffer and syslog) from uninitialized kernel memory by using a crafted USB device (posing as an io_ti USB serial device) to trigger an integer underflow.",
