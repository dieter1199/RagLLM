    "commit_message": "Fix a comment vulnerability allowing scripts to be loaded.\n\nDue to the way that comments were loaded in, it was possible to\nterminate a script and inject a new one while loading the diff viewer.\nThis isn't believed to have been a problem in the wild, but is certainly\nan important one to fix.\n\nWe now ensure that the text is escaped at the point where it's being fed\ninto the JavaScript. It's no longer possible to inject scripts.\n\nThanks to Damian Johnson for the heads up and for the fix that this\nchange is based on.\n\nThis will be going into 1.5.7 and 1.6.3 releases.",
