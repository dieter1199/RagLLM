    "commit_message": "net: rework recvmsg handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic\n\nThis patch now always passes msg->msg_namelen as 0. recvmsg handlers must\nset msg_namelen to the proper size <= sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)\nto return msg_name to the user.\n\nThis prevents numerous uninitialized memory leaks we had in the\nrecvmsg handlers and makes it harder for new code to accidentally leak\nuninitialized memory.\n\nOptimize for the case recvfrom is called with NULL as address. We don't\nneed to copy the address at all, so set it to NULL before invoking the\nrecvmsg handler. We can do so, because all the recvmsg handlers must\ncope with the case a plain read() is called on them. read() also sets\nmsg_name to NULL.\n\nAlso document these changes in include/linux/net.h as suggested by David\nMiller.\n\nChanges since RFC:\n\nSet msg->msg_name = NULL if user specified a NULL in msg_name but had a\nnon-null msg_namelen in verify_iovec/verify_compat_iovec. This doesn't\naffect sendto as it would bail out earlier while trying to copy-in the\naddress. It also more naturally reflects the logic by the callers of\nverify_iovec.\n\nWith this change in place I could remove \"\nif (!uaddr || msg_sys->msg_namelen == 0)\n\tmsg->msg_name = NULL\n\".\n\nThis change does not alter the user visible error logic as we ignore\nmsg_namelen as long as msg_name is NULL.\n\nAlso remove two unnecessary curly brackets in ___sys_recvmsg and change\ncomments to netdev style.\n\nCc: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>\nSuggested-by: Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
