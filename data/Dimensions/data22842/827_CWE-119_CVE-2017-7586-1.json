This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",

This was problematic for\ntwo reasons; this value was un-necessarily large for the majority\nof files and too small for some others.\n\nNow the size of the header buffer starts at 256 bytes and grows as\nnecessary up to a maximum of 100k.",
