    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",

Reported as MSVR 35094. Discovered by\nAxel Souchet and Vishal Chauhan from the MSRC Vulnerabilities &\nMitigations team.\n* libtiff/tif_write.c: fix issue in error code path of TIFFFlushData1()\nthat didn't reset the tif_rawcc and tif_rawcp members. I'm not\ncompletely sure if that could happen in practice outside of the odd\nbehaviour of t2p_seekproc() of tiff2pdf). The report points that a\nbetter fix could be to check the return value of TIFFFlushData1() in\nplaces where it isn't done currently, but it seems this patch is enough.\nReported as MSVR 35095.
