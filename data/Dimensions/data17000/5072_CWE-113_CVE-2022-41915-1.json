    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-41915",
    "cve_description": "Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. Starting in version 4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')",
    "cwe_description": "The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.",
    "commit_message": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hh82-3pmq-7frp\n\nMotivation:\nThe setObject methods that took arrays and iterators as arguments provided a way to bypass value validation.\n\nModification:\nAdd the missing value validation checks.\n\nResult:\nIt is no longer possibel to bypass value validation in DefaultHeaders based implementations, including DefaultHttpHeaders.",
