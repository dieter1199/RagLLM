    "cve_description": "FORT Validator versions prior to 1.5.2 will crash if an RPKI CA publishes an X.509 EE certificate. This will lead to RTR clients such as BGP routers to lose access to the RPKI VRP data set, effectively disabling Route Origin Validation.",

For seemingly no reason.\n\nNow there's only one array, and it stores the objects directly.\n\nAlso adds relevant unit tests.",
