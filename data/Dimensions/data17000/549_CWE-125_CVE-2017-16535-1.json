The code wasn't checking that the\nnext usb_dev_cap_header structure could fit into the remaining buffer\nspace.\n\nThis patch fixes the error and also reduces the bNumDeviceCaps field\nin the header to match the actual number of capabilities found, in\ncases where there are fewer than expected.\n\nReported-by: Andrey Konovalov <andreyknvl@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>\nTested-by: Andrey Konovalov <andreyknvl@google.com>\nCC: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>",
