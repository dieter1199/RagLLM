    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-14723",
    "cve_description": "Before version 4.8.2, WordPress mishandled % characters and additional placeholder values in $wpdb->prepare, and thus did not properly address the possibility of plugins and themes enabling SQL injection attacks.",
    "cve_publish_date": "2017-09-23",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
    "commit_message": "Database: Hardening for `wpdb::prepare()`\n\nPreviously if you passed an array of values for placeholders, additional values could be passed as well. Now additional values will be ignored.\n\n\nBuilt from https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk@41470\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk@41303 1a063a9b-81f0-0310-95a4-ce76da25c4cd",
