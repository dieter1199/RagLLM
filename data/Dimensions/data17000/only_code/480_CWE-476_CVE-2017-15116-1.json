* struct old_rng_alg - random number generator definition

*		     the random number out of the context provided with this
*		     call.
* @rng_reset: Reset of the random number generator by clearing the entire state.
*	       With the invocation of this function call, the random number
*             generator shall completely reinitialize its state. If the random
*	       number generator requires a seed for setting up a new state,
*	       the seed must be provided by the consumer while invoking this
*	       function. The required size of the seed is defined with
*	       @seedsize .
* @seedsize: The seed size required for a random number generator
*	      initialization defined with this variable. Some random number
*	      generators like the SP800-90A DRBG does not require a seed as the
*	      seeding is implemented internally without the need of support by
*	      the consumer. In this case, the seed size is set to zero.
