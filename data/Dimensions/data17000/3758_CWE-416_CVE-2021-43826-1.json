    "cve_description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions of Envoy a crash occurs when configured for :ref:`upstream tunneling <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.tunneling_config>` and the downstream connection disconnects while the the upstream connection or http/2 stream is still being established. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.",

    "cwe_description": "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.",
