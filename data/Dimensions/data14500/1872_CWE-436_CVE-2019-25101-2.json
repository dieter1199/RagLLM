    "commit_message": "SWAT-20: Remove header injection vulnerability on redirect\n\nThere was a Header Injection issue (remember HTTP is a text protocol and new\nlines matter).  Basically you could inject a header or even the text with\ncertain parameters.  Typically, this failed on redirects because of the location\nheader.  We now throw an exception if the redirect url includes a new line or\ncarriage return.  Neither of these are valid (though you can presumably escape\nthem).",
