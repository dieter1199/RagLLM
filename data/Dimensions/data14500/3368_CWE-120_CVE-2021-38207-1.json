    "cwe_description": "The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",

Complete lockup of TEMAC was reproducible within about 10 minutes of\na particular load.\n\nFixes: 84823ff80f74 (\"net: ll_temac: Fix race condition causing TX hang\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v5.4+\nSigned-off-by: Esben Haabendal <esben@geanix.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
