    "cve_description": "The arcmsr_iop_message_xfer function in drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 does not restrict a certain length field, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control code.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
