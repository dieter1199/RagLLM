    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11052",
    "cve_description": "In Sorcery before 0.15.0, there is a brute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use permanent account lockout. This has been patched in 0.15.0.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-307",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.",
    "commit_message": "Fix brute force vuln due to callbacks not being ran (#235)\n\nThe authenticate method previously would return before callbacks executed if an\r\ninvalid password was provided, which causes the brute force protection to only\r\nwork for the first lockout period, and only resets after a successful login.\r\n\r\nFixes #231",
