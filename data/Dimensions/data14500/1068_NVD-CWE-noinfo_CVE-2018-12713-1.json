    "cve_description": "GIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary filenames, which may result in a filename that already exists, as demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file function in app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite files or read file content that was intended to be private.",

    "commit_message": "Issue #1689: create unique temporary file with g_file_open_tmp().\n\nNot sure this is really solving the issue reported, which is that\n`g_get_tmp_dir()` uses environment variables (yet as g_file_open_tmp()\nuses g_get_tmp_dir()â€¦). But at least g_file_open_tmp() should create\nunique temporary files, which prevents overriding existing files (which\nis most likely the only real attack possible here, or at least the only\none I can think of unless some weird vulnerabilities exist in glib).",
