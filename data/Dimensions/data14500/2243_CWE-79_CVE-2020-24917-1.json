This updates `DraftAjaxAPI::_uploadInlineImage()` to sanitize the\nfilename before it's returned in the JSON encoded response. This also\nupdates `AttachmentFile::format()` to sanitize the filename before saving to\nthe backend. In addition this forces the `application/json` Content-Type on\nall AJAX responses that return strictly JSON; this adds another layer of\nprotection.",
