    "commit_message": "xen/events: defer eoi in case of excessive number of events\n\nIn case rogue guests are sending events at high frequency it might\nhappen that xen_evtchn_do_upcall() won't stop processing events in\ndom0. As this is done in irq handling a crash might be the result.\n\nIn order to avoid that, delay further inter-domain events after some\ntime in xen_evtchn_do_upcall() by forcing eoi processing into a\nworker on the same cpu, thus inhibiting new events coming in.\n\nThe time after which eoi processing is to be delayed is configurable\nvia a new module parameter \"event_loop_timeout\" which specifies the\nmaximum event loop time in jiffies (default: 2, the value was chosen\nafter some tests showing that a value of 2 was the lowest with an\nonly slight drop of dom0 network throughput while multiple guests\nperformed an event storm).\n\nHow long eoi processing will be delayed can be specified via another\nparameter \"event_eoi_delay\" (again in jiffies, default 10, again the\nvalue was chosen after testing with different delay values).\n\nThis is part of XSA-332.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReported-by: Julien Grall <julien@xen.org>\nSigned-off-by: Juergen Gross <jgross@suse.com>\nReviewed-by: Stefano Stabellini <sstabellini@kernel.org>\nReviewed-by: Wei Liu <wl@xen.org>",
