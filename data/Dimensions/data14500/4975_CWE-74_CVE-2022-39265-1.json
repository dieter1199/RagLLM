    "cve_description": "MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The _Mail Settings_ ? Additional Parameters for PHP's mail() function mail_parameters setting value, in connection with the configured mail program's options and behavior, may allow access to sensitive information and Remote Code Execution (RCE).
