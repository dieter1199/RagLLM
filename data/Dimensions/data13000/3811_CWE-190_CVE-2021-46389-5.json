    "cwe_name": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
    "commit_message": "- Modified TileManager.cc to verify that malloc() has correctly allocated memory.\n- Updated numerical types to std::size_t in RawTile.h, TileManager.cc, KakaduImage.cc, OpenJPEG.cc and Transforms.cc when allocating memory via new to avoid integer overflow - fixes remaining problems identified in https://github.com/ruven/iipsrv/issues/223.",
