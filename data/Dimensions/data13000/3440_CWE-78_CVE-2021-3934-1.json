    "commit_message": "fix(lib): fix `omz_urldecode` unsafe eval bug\n\nThe `omz_urldecode` function uses an eval to decode the input which can be\nexploited to inject commands. This is used only in the svn plugin and it\nrequires a complex process to exploit, so it is highly unlikely to have been\nused by an attacker.",
