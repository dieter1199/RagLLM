It's important to understand that if C<is_ipv4($ip)> or C<is_ipv6($ip)> return
false, then all other validation functions for that IP address family will
I<also> return false. So for example, if C<is_ipv4($ip)> is false, so are both
C<is_private_ipv4($ip)> I<and> C<is_public_ipv4($ip)>.
C<is_ipv4($ip)> as well.
However, this module's C<is_ipv4($ip)> function will return false for
addresses like "010.0.0.1" which have octal components. And of course that
means that it also returns false for C<is_private_ipv4($ip)> I<and>
C<is_public_ipv4($ip)>.
