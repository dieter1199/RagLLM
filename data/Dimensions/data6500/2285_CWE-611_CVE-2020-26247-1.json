    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-26247",
    "cve_description": "Nokogiri is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath and CSS selector support. In Nokogiri before version 1.11.0.rc4 there is an XXE vulnerability. XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema are trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security policy followed by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default whenever possible. This is fixed in Nokogiri version 1.11.0.rc4.",

    "commit_message": "feat: XML::Schema and RelaxNG creation accept optional ParseOptions\n\nI'm trying out a new pattern, which is that the parsed object carries\naround the ParseOptions it was created with, which should make some\ntesting a bit easier.\n\nI'm also not implementing the \"config block\" pattern in use for\nDocuments, because I think the UX is weird and I'm hoping to change\neverything to use kwargs in a 2.0 release, anyway.",
