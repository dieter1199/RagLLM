    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in pixHtmlViewer in prog/htmlviewer.c in Leptonica before 1.75.3. Unsanitized input (rootname) can overflow a buffer, leading potentially to arbitrary code execution or possibly unspecified other impact.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "prog/htmlviewer: Catch unbound memory access (CID 1386222)\n\nrootname can have any size, so limit the amount of copied bytes.\n\nSigned-off-by: Stefan Weil <sw@weilnetz.de>",
