    "cve_description": "Cockpit (and its plugins) do not seem to protect itself against clickjacking. It is possible to render a page from a cockpit server via another website, inside an <iFrame> HTML entry. This may be used by a malicious website in clickjacking or similar attacks.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames",
    "cwe_description": "The web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.",
    "commit_message": "common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin\n\nDeclare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can\nonly be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar\nto setting CORP in commit 2b38b8de92f9a (which applies to `<script>`,\n`<img>`, etc.).\n\nThe main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse\nproxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is\ndiscouraged these days to prevent \"clickjacking\".\n\nCross-origin embedding already did not work in most cases: Frames would\nalways just show the login page.  However, this looks confusing and is\nunclean. With X-Frame-Options, the browser instead shows an explanatory\nerror page.\n\nMention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.\n\nFixes #16122\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688\nCVE-2021-3660\n\n[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options",
