    "cve_description": "The IP stack in the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for packets with tunnel stacking, as demonstrated by interleaved IPv4 headers and GRE headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-7039.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-400",
    "cwe_name": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.",
    "commit_message": "tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.\n\nWhen drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they\nonly mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.\nSupporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,\nmore IP length fields and they are unaware of this.\n\nNo encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded\nencapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames\nin the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for\nmultiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.\n\nUDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only\nhandles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This\ngeneralizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking\nthat would cause problems.\n\nFixes: bf5a755f (\"net-gre-gro: Add GRE support to the GRO stack\")\nSigned-off-by: Jesse Gross <jesse@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
