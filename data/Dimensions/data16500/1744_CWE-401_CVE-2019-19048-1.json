    "cve_description": "A memory leak in the crypto_reportstat() function in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_utils.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering copy_form_user() failures, aka CID-e0b0cb938864.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-401",
    "cwe_name": "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.",
    "commit_message": "virt: vbox: fix memory leak in hgcm_call_preprocess_linaddr\n\nIn hgcm_call_preprocess_linaddr memory is allocated for bounce_buf but\nis not released if copy_form_user fails. In order to prevent memory leak\nin case of failure, the assignment to bounce_buf_ret is moved before the\nerror check. This way the allocated bounce_buf will be released by the\ncaller.\n\nFixes: 579db9d45cb4 (\"virt: Add vboxguest VMMDEV communication code\")\nSigned-off-by: Navid Emamdoost <navid.emamdoost@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20190930204223.3660-1-navid.emamdoost@gmail.com\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>",
