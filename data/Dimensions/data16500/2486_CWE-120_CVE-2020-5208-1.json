    "cve_description": "It's been found that multiple functions in ipmitool before 1.8.19 neglect proper checking of the data received from a remote LAN party, which may lead to buffer overflows and potentially to remote code execution on the ipmitool side. This is especially dangerous if ipmitool is run as a privileged user. This problem is fixed in version 1.8.19.",

    "cwe_description": "The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "commit_message": "fru: Fix buffer overflow vulnerabilities\n\nPartial fix for CVE-2020-5208, see\nhttps://github.com/ipmitool/ipmitool/security/advisories/GHSA-g659-9qxw-p7cp\n\nThe `read_fru_area_section` function only performs size validation of\nrequested read size, and falsely assumes that the IPMI message will not\nrespond with more than the requested amount of data; it uses the\nunvalidated response size to copy into `frubuf`. If the response is\nlarger than the request, this can result in overflowing the buffer.\n\nThe same issue affects the `read_fru_area` function.",
