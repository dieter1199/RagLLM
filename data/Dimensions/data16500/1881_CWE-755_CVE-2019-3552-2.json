    "cve_description": "C++ Facebook Thrift servers (using cpp2) would not error upon receiving messages with containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.02.18.00.",

In case when we have an invalid data, we may get a container of a large size with a bad type, this would lead to us running long loop doing nothing (though we already can say that the data is invalid).\n\nThe new code would throw an exception as soon as we try to skip a value of invalid type.\n\nFixes CVE-2019-3552\n\nReviewed By: yfeldblum, stevegury\n\nDifferential Revision: D8344920\n\nfbshipit-source-id: f12e8f3442f7ad5e1a81d822380701e929b80f0d",
