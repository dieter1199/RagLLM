    "cve_description": "A buffer overflow in the M_LoadDefaults function in m_misc.c in id Tech 1 (aka Doom engine) allows arbitrary code execution via an unsafe usage of fscanf, because it does not limit the number of characters to be read in a format argument.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-120",
    "cwe_name": "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')",
    "cwe_description": "The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "commit_message": "Fix buffer overflow in M_LoadDefaults\n\nToo much data will most likely result in a crash or freeze, but you can overwrite the stack which can be used to do an arbitrary code execution. (https://twitter.com/notrevenant/status/1268654123903340544)",
