This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "vfio/pci: Fix integer overflows, bitmask check\n\nThe VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl did not sufficiently sanitize\nuser-supplied integers, potentially allowing memory corruption. This\npatch adds appropriate integer overflow checks, checks the range bounds\nfor VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE, and also verifies that only single element\nin the VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK bitmask is set.\nVFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TYPE_MASK is already correctly checked later in\nvfio_pci_set_irqs_ioctl().\n\nFurthermore, a kzalloc is changed to a kcalloc because the use of a\nkzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow\ncondition to be reached without this patch. kcalloc checks for overflow\nand should prevent a similar occurrence.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vlad Tsyrklevich <vlad@tsyrklevich.net>\nSigned-off-by: Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@redhat.com>",
