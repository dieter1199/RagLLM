    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
    "commit_message": "Added protections against path traversal in file system operations\n\n- Files within the storage/ path could be accessed via path traversal\n  references in content, accessed upon HTML export.\n- This addresses this via two layers:\n  - Scoped local flysystem filesystems down to the specific image &\n    file folders since flysystem has built-in checking against the\n    escaping of the root folder.\n  - Added path normalization before enforcement of uploads/{images,file}\n    prefix to prevent traversal at a path level.\n\nThanks to @Haxatron via huntr.dev for discovery and reporting.\nRef: https://huntr.dev/bounties/ac268a17-72b5-446f-a09a-9945ef58607a/",
