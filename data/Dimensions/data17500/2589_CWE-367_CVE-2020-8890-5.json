    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in MISP before 2.4.121. It mishandled time skew (between the machine hosting the web server and the machine hosting the database) when trying to block a brute-force series of invalid requests.",
    "cve_publish_date": "2020-02-12",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-367",
    "cwe_name": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition",
    "cwe_description": "The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.",
    "commit_message": "fix: [security] Further fixes to the bruteforce handling\n\n- resolved a potential failure of the subsystem when the MySQL and the webserver time settings are diverged\n  - as reported by Dawid Czarnecki\n- several tightenings of the checks to avoid potential foul play",
