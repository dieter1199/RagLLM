    "cwe_description": "The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.",
    "commit_message": "xsk: Add missing check on user supplied headroom size\n\nAdd a check that the headroom cannot be larger than the available\nspace in the chunk. In the current code, a malicious user can set the\nheadroom to a value larger than the chunk size minus the fixed XDP\nheadroom. That way packets with a length larger than the supported\nsize in the umem could get accepted and result in an out-of-bounds\nwrite.\n\nFixes: c0c77d8fb787 (\"xsk: add user memory registration support sockopt\")\nReported-by: Bui Quang Minh <minhquangbui99@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Magnus Karlsson <magnus.karlsson@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>\nLink: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207225\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/1586849715-23490-1-git-send-email-magnus.karlsson@intel.com",
