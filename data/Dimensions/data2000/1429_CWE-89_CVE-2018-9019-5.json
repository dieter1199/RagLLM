    "cve_description": "SQL Injection vulnerability in Dolibarr before version 7.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sortfield parameter to /accountancy/admin/accountmodel.php, /accountancy/admin/categories_list.php, /accountancy/admin/journals_list.php, /admin/dict.php, /admin/mails_templates.php, or /admin/website.php.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
