    "cve_description": "A memory leak in the nl80211_get_ftm_responder_stats() function in net/wireless/nl80211.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering nl80211hdr_put() failures, aka CID-1399c59fa929. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because it occurs on a code path where a successful allocation has already occurred",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-401",
    "cwe_name": "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.",
