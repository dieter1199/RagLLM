    "commit_message": "random32: update the net random state on interrupt and activity\n\nThis modifies the first 32 bits out of the 128 bits of a random CPU's\nnet_rand_state on interrupt or CPU activity to complicate remote\nobservations that could lead to guessing the network RNG's internal\nstate.\n\nNote that depending on some network devices' interrupt rate moderation\nor binding, this re-seeding might happen on every packet or even almost\nnever.\n\nIn addition, with NOHZ some CPUs might not even get timer interrupts,\nleaving their local state rarely updated, while they are running\nnetworked processes making use of the random state.  For this reason, we\nalso perform this update in update_process_times() in order to at least\nupdate the state when there is user or system activity, since it's the\nonly case we care about.\n\nReported-by: Amit Klein <aksecurity@gmail.com>\nSuggested-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>\nCc: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>\nCc: \"Jason A.
