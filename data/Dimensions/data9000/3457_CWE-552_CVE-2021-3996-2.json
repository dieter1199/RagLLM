    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-3996",
    "cve_description": "A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows a local user on a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory. An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.",

Since kernel commit 9d4d65748a5ca26ea8650e50ba521295549bf4e3\n(Dec 2014) kernel does not use this suffix for mount stuff in /proc at\nall. Let's remove this support from libmount too.\n\nSigned-off-by: Karel Zak <kzak@redhat.com>",
