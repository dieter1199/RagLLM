    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-10638",
    "cve_description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.",

    "cwe_name": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "cwe_description": "The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.",
    "commit_message": "inet: switch IP ID generator to siphash\n\nAccording to Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas, IP ID generation is too weak\nand might be used by attackers.\n\nEven with recent net_hash_mix() fix (netns: provide pure entropy for net_hash_mix())\nhaving 64bit key and Jenkins hash is risky.\n\nIt is time to switch to siphash and its 128bit keys.\n\nSigned-off-by: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>\nReported-by: Amit Klein <aksecurity@gmail.com>\nReported-by: Benny Pinkas <benny@pinkas.net>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
