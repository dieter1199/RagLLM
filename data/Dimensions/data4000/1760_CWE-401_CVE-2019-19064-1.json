    "cve_description": "A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering pm_runtime_get_sync() failures, aka CID-057b8945f78f. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control these failures at probe time",

    "cwe_description": "The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.",
    "commit_message": "spi: lpspi: fix memory leak in fsl_lpspi_probe\n\nIn fsl_lpspi_probe an SPI controller is allocated either via\nspi_alloc_slave or spi_alloc_master. In all but one error cases this\ncontroller is put by going to error handling code. This commit fixes the\ncase when pm_runtime_get_sync fails and it should go to the error\nhandling path.\n\nFixes: 944c01a889d9 (\"spi: lpspi: enable runtime pm for lpspi\")\nSigned-off-by: Navid Emamdoost <navid.emamdoost@gmail.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20190930034602.1467-1-navid.emamdoost@gmail.com\nSigned-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>",
