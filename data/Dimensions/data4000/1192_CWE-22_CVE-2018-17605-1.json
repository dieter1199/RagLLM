    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in the Asset Pipeline plugin before 3.0.4 for Grails. An attacker can perform directory traversal via a crafted request when a servlet-based application is executed in Jetty, because there is a classloader vulnerability that can allow a reverse file traversal route in AssetPipelineFilter.groovy or AssetPipelineFilterCore.groovy.",

    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
