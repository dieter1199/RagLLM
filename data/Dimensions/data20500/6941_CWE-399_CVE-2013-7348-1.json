If aio_setup_ring()\nfails to do so it would call aio_free_ring() before returning, but\nioctx_alloc() would call aio_free_ring() again causing a double free of\nthe ring.\n\nThis is easily reproducible from userspace.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sasha Levin <sasha.levin@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: Benjamin LaHaise <bcrl@kvack.org>",
