    "cve_description": "In radare2 before version 4.5.0, malformed PDB file names in the PDB server path cause shell injection. To trigger the problem it's required to open the executable in radare2 and run idpd to trigger the download. The shell code will execute, and will create a file called pwned in the current directory.",

    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.",
