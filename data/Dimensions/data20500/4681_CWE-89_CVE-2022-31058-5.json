    "cve_description": "Tuleap is a Free & Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. In versions prior to 13.9.99.95 Tuleap does not sanitize properly user inputs when constructing the SQL query to retrieve data for the tracker reports. An attacker with the capability to create a new tracker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
