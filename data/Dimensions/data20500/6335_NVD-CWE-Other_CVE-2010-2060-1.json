    "commit_message": "Discard job body bytes if the job is too big.\n\nPreviously, a malicious user could craft a job payload and inject\nbeanstalk commands without the client application knowing. (An\nextra-careful client library could check the size of the job body before\nsending the put command, but most libraries do not do this, nor should\nthey have to.)\n\nReported by Graham Barr.",
