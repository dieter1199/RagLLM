However, the outdated version of gradio it employs is susceptible to path traversal, as identified in CVE-2023-51449. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended restrictions and access sensitive files, such as `config.json`, which contains API keys. The issue affects the latest version of chuanhuchatgpt prior to the fixed version released on 20240305.",
