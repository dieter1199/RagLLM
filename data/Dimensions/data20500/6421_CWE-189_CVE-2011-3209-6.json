The signed version also doesn't handle a negative divisor and\nproduces worse code on 64bit archs.\n\nThere is little incentive to keep this API alive, so this converts the few\nusers to the new API.\n\nSigned-off-by: Roman Zippel <zippel@linux-m68k.org>\nCc: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>\nCc: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>\nCc: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nCc: john stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>\nCc: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
