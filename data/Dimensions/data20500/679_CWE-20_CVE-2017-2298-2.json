    "cve_description": "The mcollective-sshkey-security plugin before 0.5.1 for Puppet uses a server-specified identifier as part of a path where a file is written. A compromised server could use this to write a file to an arbitrary location on the client with the filename appended with the string \"_pub.pem\".",

    "commit_message": "(MCOP-600) Prevent public key overwriting attack via identity\n\nWhen using two-way automatic public key distribution, each end writes\nthe others `identity` as a public key file locally. No validation was\ndone on the `identity`, so it could trigger directory traversal and\nallow the attacker to overwrite an unexpected file (like a trusted\npublic key certificate). Prevent this by verifying identity does not\nresult in traversing outside the intended distribution directory.",
