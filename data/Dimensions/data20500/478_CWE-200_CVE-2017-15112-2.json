    "commit_message": "CVE-2017-15112 unsafe use of -p/--admin-password on command line\n\nIt is unsafe to pass a password as part of the command line args\nbecause it appears in the process info and is recorded in the\nshell command history.\n\nThe -p --keycloak-admin-password arg has been replaced with -P\n--keycloak-admin-password-file which reads the password from a file or\nstdin if given a hyphen. The now deprecated --keycloak-admin-password\nalso accepted stdin with a hyphen, this was retained for backward\ncompatibility during a transition period, it will issue a deprecation\nwarning. Trying to use --keycloak-admin-password with anything other\nthan a hyphen will result in an error and explanation.\n\nThe man page was updated to include a section on password passing and\nincludes documention on using the KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment\nvariable (which was always supported but never documented).\n\nThe --admin-password command line arg in keycloak_cli.py was also\nupdated in a similar manner and now also includes support for\nKEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable.",
