    "cve_description": "In Libav through 11.11 and 12.x through 12.1, the smacker_decode_tree function in libavcodec/smacker.c does not properly restrict tree recursion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bitstream.c:build_table() out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Smacker stream.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
