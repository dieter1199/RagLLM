    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "ieee802154: atusb: do not use the stack for buffers to make them DMA able\n\nFrom 4.9 we should really avoid using the stack here as this will not be DMA\nable on various platforms. This changes the buffers already being present in\ntime of 4.9 being released. This should go into stable as well.\n\nReported-by: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Stefan Schmidt <stefan@osg.samsung.com>\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
