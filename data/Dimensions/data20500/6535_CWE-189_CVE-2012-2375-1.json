    "cve_description": "The __nfs4_get_acl_uncached function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in the NFSv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.3.2 uses an incorrect length variable during a copy operation, which allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by sending an excessive number of bitmap words in an FATTR4_ACL reply.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-4131.",
