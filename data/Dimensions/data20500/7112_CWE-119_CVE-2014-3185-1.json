    "cve_description": "Multiple buffer overflows in the command_port_read_callback function in drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c in the Whiteheat USB Serial Driver in the Linux kernel before 3.16.2 allow physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) via a crafted device that provides a large amount of (1) EHCI or (2) XHCI data associated with a bulk response.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-119",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "USB: whiteheat: Added bounds checking for bulk command response\n\nThis patch fixes a potential security issue in the whiteheat USB driver\nwhich might allow a local attacker to cause kernel memory corrpution. This\nis due to an unchecked memcpy into a fixed size buffer (of 64 bytes). On\nEHCI and XHCI busses it's possible to craft responses greater than 64\nbytes leading a buffer overflow.\n\nSigned-off-by: James Forshaw <forshaw@google.com>\nCc: stable <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>",
