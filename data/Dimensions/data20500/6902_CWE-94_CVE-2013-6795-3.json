    "cve_description": "The Updater in Rackspace Openstack Windows Guest Agent for XenServer before 1.2.6.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized .NET object to TCP port 1984, which triggers the download and extraction of a ZIP file that overwrites the Agent service binary.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-94",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.",
    "commit_message": "Updated the agent and updater to use IPC communications rather than TCP.  Altered the updater update command to make it more resilient and updated the version number for a new build.",
