Parsing only the rest of the line\nfor security issues. This is a major security bug.\n\nThis commits also corrects a previous ommited correction regarding the\ncontrol charaters, that permitted to escape from lshell.\n\nThank you Proskurin Kirill (@Oloremo) and Vladislav Yarmak (@Snawoot)\nfor reporting this!!",
