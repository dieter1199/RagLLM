    "cve_description": "TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow, which could be triggered from DecodeManager::decodeRect. Vulnerability occurs due to the signdness error in processing MemOutStream. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.",
