    "cve_description": "Double free vulnerability in the mem_close function in jas_stream.c in JasPer before 1.900.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted BMP image to the imginfo command.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-415",
    "cwe_name": "Double Free",
    "cwe_description": "The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.",
    "commit_message": "The memory stream interface allows for a buffer size of zero.\nThe case of a zero-sized buffer was not handled correctly, as it could\nlead to a double free.\nThis problem has now been fixed (hopefully).\nOne might ask whether a zero-sized buffer should be allowed at all,\nbut this is a question for another day.",
