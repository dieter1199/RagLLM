    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-27291",
    "cve_description": "In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.",
