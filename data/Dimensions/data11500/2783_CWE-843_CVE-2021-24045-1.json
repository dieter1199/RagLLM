    "cve_description": "A type confusion vulnerability could be triggered when resolving the \"typeof\" unary operator in Facebook Hermes prior to v0.10.0. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",

    "cwe_description": "The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.",
