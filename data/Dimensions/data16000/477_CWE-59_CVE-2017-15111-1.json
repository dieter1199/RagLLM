It can be invoked on it's own,\nmostly for testing or to execute just one part of the Keycloak REST\nAPI. It's log file defaulted to /tmp/{prog_name}.log where prog_name\nis the name of the program that invoked it. That default was changed\nto {prog_name}.log so the log file is created in the current directory\ninstead of under /tmp. Use of the /var/log directory was avoided\nbecause that requires root privileges.",
