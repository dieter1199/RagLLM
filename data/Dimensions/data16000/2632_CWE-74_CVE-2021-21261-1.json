    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-21261",
    "cve_description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.",

    "commit_message": "run: Convert all environment variables into bwrap arguments\n\nThis avoids some of them being filtered out by a setuid bwrap. It also\nmeans that if they came from an untrusted source, they cannot be used\nto inject arbitrary code into a non-setuid bwrap via mechanisms like\nLD_PRELOAD.\n\nBecause they get bundled into a memfd or temporary file, they do not\nactually appear in argv, ensuring that they remain inaccessible to\nprocesses running under a different uid (which is important if their\nvalues are tokens or other secrets).\n\nSigned-off-by: Simon McVittie <smcv@collabora.com>\nPart-of: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppf-fxf6-vxg2",
