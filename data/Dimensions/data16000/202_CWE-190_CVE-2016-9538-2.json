    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",

Found on test case of MSVR 35100.\n* tools/tiffcrop.c: fix read of undefined buffer in\nreadContigStripsIntoBuffer() due to uint16 overflow. Probably not a\nsecurity issue but I can be wrong.
