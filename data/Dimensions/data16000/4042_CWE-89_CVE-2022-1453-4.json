    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-1453",
    "cve_description": "The RSVPMaker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection due to missing SQL escaping and parameterization on user supplied data passed to a SQL query in the rsvpmaker-util.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to steal sensitive information from the database in versions up to and including 9.2.5.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
