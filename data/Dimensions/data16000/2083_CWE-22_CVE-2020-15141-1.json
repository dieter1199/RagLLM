    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-15141",
    "cve_description": "In openapi-python-client before version 0.5.3, there is a path traversal vulnerability. If a user generated a client using a maliciously crafted OpenAPI document, it is possible for generated files to be placed in arbitrary locations on disk.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-22",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')",
    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
    "commit_message": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7wgr-7666-7pwj\n\n* All strings used as file/directory names are now sanitized to address the path traversal vulnerabilities\n\n* Switched calls to utils.spinal_case to utils.kebab_case\n\nCo-authored-by: Ethan Mann <emann@triaxtec.com>",
