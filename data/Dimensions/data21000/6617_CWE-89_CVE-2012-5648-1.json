    "cve_description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Foreman before 1.0.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified parameters to (1) app/models/hostext/search.rb or (2) app/models/puppetclass.rb, related to the search mechanism.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
