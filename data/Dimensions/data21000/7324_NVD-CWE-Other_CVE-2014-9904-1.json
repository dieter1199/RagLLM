    "cwe_description": "NVD is only using a subset of CWE for mapping instead of the entire CWE, and the weakness type is not covered by that subset.",
    "commit_message": "ALSA: compress: fix an integer overflow check\n\nI previously added an integer overflow check here but looking at it now,\nit's still buggy.\n\nThe bug happens in snd_compr_allocate_buffer().  We multiply\n\".fragments\" and \".fragment_size\" and that doesn't overflow but then we\nsave it in an unsigned int so it truncates the high bits away and we\nallocate a smaller than expected size.\n\nFixes: b35cc8225845 ('ALSA: compress_core: integer overflow in snd_compr_allocate_buffer()')\nSigned-off-by: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
