    "commit_message": "Reimplement httpd's support for byte ranges.\n\nThe previous implementation loaded all the output into a single output\nbuffer and used its size to determine the Content-Length of the body.\n\nThe new implementation calculates the body length first and writes the\nindividual ranges in an async way using the bufferevent mechanism.\n\nThis prevents httpd from using too much memory and applies the\nwatermark and throttling mechanisms to range requests.\n\nProblem reported by Pierre Kim (pierre.kim.sec at gmail.com)\n\nOK benno@ sunil@",
