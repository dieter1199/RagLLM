    "commit_message": "net: fix incorrect credentials passing\n\nCommit 257b5358b32f (\"scm: Capture the full credentials of the scm\nsender\") changed the credentials passing code to pass in the effective\nuid/gid instead of the real uid/gid.\n\nObviously this doesn't matter most of the time (since normally they are\nthe same), but it results in differences for suid binaries when the wrong\nuid/gid ends up being used.\n\nThis just undoes that (presumably unintentional) part of the commit.\n\nReported-by: Andy Lutomirski <luto@amacapital.net>\nCc: Eric W.
