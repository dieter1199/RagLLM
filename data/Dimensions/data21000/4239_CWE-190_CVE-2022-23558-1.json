    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-23558",
    "cve_description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in `TfLiteIntArrayCreate`. The `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` returns an `int` instead of a `size_t. An attacker can control model inputs such that `computed_size` overflows the size of `int` datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
