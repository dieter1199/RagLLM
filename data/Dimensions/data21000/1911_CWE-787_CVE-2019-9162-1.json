    "cve_description": "In the Linux kernel before 4.20.12, net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_snmp_basic_main.c in the SNMP NAT module has insufficient ASN.1 length checks (aka an array index error), making out-of-bounds read and write operations possible, leading to an OOPS or local privilege escalation. This affects snmp_version and snmp_helper.",

    "cwe_name": "Out-of-bounds Write",
    "cwe_description": "The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.",
    "commit_message": "netfilter: nf_nat_snmp_basic: add missing length checks in ASN.1 cbs\n\nThe generic ASN.1 decoder infrastructure doesn't guarantee that callbacks\nwill get as much data as they expect; callbacks have to check the `datalen`\nparameter before looking at `data`. Make sure that snmp_version() and\nsnmp_helper() don't read/write beyond the end of the packet data.\n\n(Also move the assignment to `pdata` down below the check to make it clear\nthat it isn't necessarily a pointer we can use before the `datalen` check.)\n\nFixes: cc2d58634e0f (\"netfilter: nf_nat_snmp_basic: use asn1 decoder library\")\nSigned-off-by: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>",
