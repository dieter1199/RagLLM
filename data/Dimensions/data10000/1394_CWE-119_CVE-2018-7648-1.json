    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in mj2/opj_mj2_extract.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.0. The output prefix was not checked for length, which could overflow a buffer, when providing a prefix with 50 or more characters on the command line.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-119",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "opj_mj2_extract: Check provided output prefix for length\n\nThis uses snprintf() with correct buffer length instead of sprintf(), which\nprevents a buffer overflow when providing a long output prefix. Furthermore\nthe program exits with an error when the provided output prefix is too long.\n\nFixes #1088.",
