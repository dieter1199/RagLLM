    "cve_description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D` does not fully validate the input arguments. In this case, references get bound to `nullptr` for each argument that is empty. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",

    "cwe_description": "NVD is only using a subset of CWE for mapping instead of the entire CWE, and the weakness type is not covered by that subset.",
    "commit_message": "Fix undefined behavior in QuantizedConv2D\n\nAdded more input validation and tests.  Prior to this, we could get\n`nullptr` exceptions when attempting to access 0th elements of 0-sized\ninputs, leading to security vulnerability bugs.\n\nAlso needed to modify `quantized_conv_ops_test.cc` for consistency.\nPreviously the CPU kernel did technically support passing tensors\nof rank larger than 0 for min/max values.  However, the XLA kernels do not.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 445518507",
