    "commit_message": "Preserve GSS context on init/accept failure\n\nAfter gss_init_sec_context() or gss_accept_sec_context() has created a\ncontext, don't delete the mechglue context on failures from subsequent\ncalls, even if the mechanism deletes the mech-specific context (which\nis allowed by RFC 2744 but not preferred).  Check for union contexts\nwith no mechanism context in each GSS function which accepts a\ngss_ctx_id_t.\n\nCVE-2017-11462:\n\nRFC 2744 permits a GSS-API implementation to delete an existing\nsecurity context on a second or subsequent call to\ngss_init_sec_context() or gss_accept_sec_context() if the call results\nin an error.  This API behavior has been found to be dangerous,\nleading to the possibility of memory errors in some callers.  For\nsafety, GSS-API implementations should instead preserve existing\nsecurity contexts on error until the caller deletes them.\n\nAll versions of MIT krb5 prior to this change may delete acceptor\ncontexts on error.  Versions 1.13.4 through 1.13.7, 1.14.1 through\n1.14.5, and 1.15 through 1.15.1 may also delete initiator contexts on\nerror.\n\nticket: 8598 (new)\ntarget_version: 1.15-next\ntarget_version: 1.14-next\ntags: pullup",
