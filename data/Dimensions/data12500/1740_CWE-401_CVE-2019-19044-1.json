One is when allocation for bin fails, and the other is when bin\ninitialization fails. If kcalloc fails to allocate memory for bin then\nrender->base should be put. Also, if v3d_job_init() fails to initialize\nbin->base then allocated memory for bin should be released.\n\nFixes: a783a09ee76d (\"drm/v3d: Refactor job management.\")\nSigned-off-by: Navid Emamdoost <navid.emamdoost@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>\nLink: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20191021185250.26130-1-navid.emamdoost@gmail.com",
