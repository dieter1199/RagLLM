    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-23606",
    "cve_description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.",

    "cwe_name": "Uncontrolled Recursion",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.",
    "commit_message": "CVE-2022-23606\n\nAvoid closing other connections to prevent deep recursion when a large number of idle connections are closed at the start of a pool drain, when a connection is closed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yan Avlasov <yavlasov@google.com>",
