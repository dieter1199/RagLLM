    "cve_description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`. This is because of missing validation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/fdc82089d206e281c628a93771336bf87863d5e8/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L230-L231) that was covered under a `TODO`. If the `dense_shape` tensor is empty, then `dense_shape_t.vec<>()` would cause a null pointer dereference in the implementation of the op. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
