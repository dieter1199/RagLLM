    "commit_message": "Fix line wrapping mode 0/3 bugs\n\nThis fixes two separate bugs:\n\na) Don't move a linebreak into the first symbol. This results in a empty\n   line at the front, which does not help to equalize line lengths at all.\n   Instead, merge line with the second one.\nb) When moving a linebreak into a symbol that already is a break, the\n   number of lines must be decremented. Otherwise, uninitialized memory\n   is possibly used for later layout operations.\n\nFound by fuzzer test case\nid:000085,sig:11,src:003377+003350,op:splice,rep:8.\n\nThis might also affect and hopefully fix libass#229.\n\nv2: change semantics according to review",
