    "commit_message": "Replace marshalling with pluggable serializers\n\nThis is in response to a vulnerability warning we received on Friday,\nAugust 11th, 2017. While most users will not be affected by this\nchange, we recommend that developers of new applications use a different\nserializer other than `Marshal`. This, along with the removal of the\n`:marshalling` option, will enforce \"sane defaults\" in terms of securely\nserializing/de-serializing data.\n\n- Add `:serializer` option and deprecate `:marshalling`. Although you\n  will still be able to enable/disable serialization with Marshal using\n  `:marshalling` in the 1.x series, this will be removed by 2.0.\n\n- Rename `Redis::Store::Marshalling` to `Redis::Store::Serialization` to\n  reflect its new purpose.\n\nFixes #289",
