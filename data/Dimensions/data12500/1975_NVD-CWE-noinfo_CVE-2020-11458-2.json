    "cve_description": "app/Model/feed.php in MISP before 2.4.124 allows administrators to choose arbitrary files that should be ingested by MISP. This does not cause a leak of the full contents of a file, but does cause a leaks of strings that match certain patterns. Among the data that can leak are passwords from database.php or GPG key passphrases from config.php.",

    "commit_message": "chg: [security] Added setting to restrict the encoding of local feeds\n\n- By adding local feeds, a malicious administrator could point MISP to ingest configuration files that the apache user has access to\n- This includes some more sensitive files (database.php / config.php / .gnupg data)\n- Whilst this is currently not leading to an exploitable vulnerability as the current implementation wouldn't trigger on the values,\n  having a setting to disable this will become much more interesting once we have a system in place for custom feed parsers\n- The setting can only be enabled/disabled via the CLI\n\n- As reported by Matthias Weckbecker",
