    "cwe_description": "The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.",
    "commit_message": "Fix #492: Potential double-free in gdImage*Ptr()\n\nWhenever `gdImage*Ptr()` calls `gdImage*Ctx()` and the latter fails, we\nmust not call `gdDPExtractData()`; otherwise a double-free would\nhappen.  Since `gdImage*Ctx()` are void functions, and we can't change\nthat for BC reasons, we're introducing static helpers which are used\ninternally.\n\nWe're adding a regression test for `gdImageJpegPtr()`, but not for\n`gdImageGifPtr()` and `gdImageWbmpPtr()` since we don't know how to\ntrigger failure of the respective `gdImage*Ctx()` calls.\n\nThis potential security issue has been reported by Solmaz Salimi (aka.\nRooney).",
