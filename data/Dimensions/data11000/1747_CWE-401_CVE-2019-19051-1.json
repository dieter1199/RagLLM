The\ndocumentation for i2400m_msg_to_dev() says when it returns the buffer\ncan be reused. Meaning cmd should be released in either case. Move\nkfree(cmd) before return to be reached by all execution paths.\n\nFixes: 2507e6ab7a9a (\"wimax: i2400: fix memory leak\")\nSigned-off-by: Navid Emamdoost <navid.emamdoost@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
