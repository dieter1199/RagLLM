    "cve_description": "In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.",

    "commit_message": "Default initialize fixed point Eigen types.\n\nIn certain cases, tensors are filled with default values of the type. But, for these fixed point types, these values were uninitialized. Thus, we would have uninitialized memory access bugs, some of which were caught by MSAN.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 344101137\nChange-Id: I14555fda74dca3b5f1582da9008901937e3f14e2",
