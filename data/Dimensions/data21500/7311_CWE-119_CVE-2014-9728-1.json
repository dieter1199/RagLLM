    "cve_description": "The UDF filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not validate certain lengths, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and system crash) via a crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/inode.c and fs/udf/symlink.c.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "udf: Verify symlink size before loading it\n\nUDF specification allows arbitrarily large symlinks. However we support\nonly symlinks at most one block large. Check the length of the symlink\nso that we don't access memory beyond end of the symlink block.\n\nCC: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReported-by: Carl Henrik Lunde <chlunde@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>",
