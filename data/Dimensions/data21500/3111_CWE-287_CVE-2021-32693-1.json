    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32693",
    "cve_description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication is in Symfony starting with version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When an application defines multiple firewalls, the token authenticated by one of the firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This could be abused when the application defines different providers for each part of the application, in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of the application could be considered authenticated on the rest of the application. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that the authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.",
