Instead, mark the\ncontext as terminated, and check for terminated contexts in the GSS\nfunctions which expect established contexts.  Also add checks in\nexport_sec_context and pseudo_random, and adjust t_prf.c for the\npseudo_random check.\n\nticket: 8055 (new)\ntarget_version: 1.13.1\ntags: pullup",
