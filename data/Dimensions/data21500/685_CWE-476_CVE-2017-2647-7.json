    "commit_message": "KEYS: Remove key_type::match in favour of overriding default by match_preparse\n\nA previous patch added a ->match_preparse() method to the key type.  This is\nallowed to override the function called by the iteration algorithm.\nTherefore, we can just set a default that simply checks for an exact match of\nthe key description with the original criterion data and allow match_preparse\nto override it as needed.\n\nThe key_type::match op is then redundant and can be removed, as can the\nuser_match() function.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>\nAcked-by: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@redhat.com>",
