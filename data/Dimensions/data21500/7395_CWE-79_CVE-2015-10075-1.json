    "commit_message": "Validate width values to avoid unlikely security vulnerabilities.\n\nIf the database were compromised, a value like `500\" onclick=\"alert(1)\" foo=\"` could be inserted into the `custom_content_width` option, resulting in XSS. If the attacker had full access to the database, then they could obviously do much more damage, regardless of whether the widths are validated or not, but there are other scenarios where validating the widths could mitigate an attack, like if a vulnerability elsewhere allowed an attacker to insert an arbitrary value into an arbitrary option record, but they needed to find one that wasn't being escaped.\n\nThat's not very likely, but it's better to be safe than sorry.",
