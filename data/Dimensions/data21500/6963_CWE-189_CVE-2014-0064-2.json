Writes past the end\nof the inadvertent small allocation followed shortly thereafter.\nCoverity identified the path_in() vulnerability; code inspection led to\nthe rest.  In passing, add check_stack_depth() to prevent stack overflow\nin related functions.\n\nBack-patch to 8.4 (all supported versions).  The non-comment hstore\nchanges touch code that did not exist in 8.4, so that part stops at 9.0.\n\nNoah Misch and Heikki Linnakangas, reviewed by Tom Lane.\n\nSecurity: CVE-2014-0064",
