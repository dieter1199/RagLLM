Add some tests to the\ntest-suite to be sure we don't inadvertently reintroduce this problem.\nUnfortunately they're quite noisy so include a message to disregard\nthe warnings.\n\nReported-by: Zhenghan Wang <wzhmmmmm@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Wilcox (Oracle) <willy@infradead.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
