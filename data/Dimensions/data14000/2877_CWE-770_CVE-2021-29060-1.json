    "commit_message": "fix ReDos in hwb() parser (low-severity)\n\nDiscovered by Yeting Li, c/o Colin Ife via Snyk.io.\n\nA ReDos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability\nwas responsibly disclosed to me via email by Colin on\nMar 5 2021 regarding an exponential time complexity for\nlinearly increasing input lengths for `hwb()` color strings.\n\nStrings reaching more than 5000 characters would see several\nmilliseconds of processing time; strings reaching more than\n50,000 characters began seeing 1500ms (1.5s) of processing time.\n\nThe cause was due to a the regular expression that parses\nhwb() strings - specifically, the hue value - where\nthe integer portion of the hue value used a 0-or-more quantifier\nshortly thereafter followed by a 1-or-more quantifier.\n\nThis caused excessive backtracking and a cartesian scan,\nresulting in exponential time complexity given a linear\nincrease in input length.\n\nThank you Yeting Li and Colin Ife for bringing this to my\nattention in a secure, responsible and professional manner.\n\nA CVE will not be assigned for this vulnerability.",
