    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap()\n\nUser-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw\nIE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding\nthe allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it\ninto a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be\ncorrupted and used as exploit.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v4.7\nReported-by: Daxing Guo <freener.gdx@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Hante Meuleman <hante.meuleman@broadcom.com>\nReviewed-by: Pieter-Paul Giesberts <pieter-paul.giesberts@broadcom.com>\nReviewed-by: Franky Lin <franky.lin@broadcom.com>\nSigned-off-by: Arend van Spriel <arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kalle Valo <kvalo@codeaurora.org>",
