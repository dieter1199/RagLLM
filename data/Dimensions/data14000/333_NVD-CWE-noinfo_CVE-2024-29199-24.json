    "cve_description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A number of Nautobot URL endpoints were found to be improperly accessible to unauthenticated (anonymous) users. These endpoints will not disclose any Nautobot data to an unauthenticated user unless the Nautobot configuration variable EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS is changed from its default value (an empty list) to permit access to specific data by unauthenticated users. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.16 and 2.1.9.",
