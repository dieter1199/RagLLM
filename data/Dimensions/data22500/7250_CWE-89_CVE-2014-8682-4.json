    "cve_description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Gogs (aka Go Git Service) 0.3.1-9 through 0.5.x before 0.5.6.1105 Beta allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the q parameter to (1) api/v1/repos/search, which is not properly handled in models/repo.go, or (2) api/v1/users/search, which is not properly handled in models/user.go.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
