    "cve_description": "The UDF filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not validate certain lengths, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and system crash) via a crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/inode.c and fs/udf/symlink.c.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",

Also properly ignore component length for\ncomponent types that do not use it. Otherwise we read memory after end\nof buffer for corrupted udf image.\n\nReported-by: Carl Henrik Lunde <chlunde@ping.uio.no>\nCC: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>",
