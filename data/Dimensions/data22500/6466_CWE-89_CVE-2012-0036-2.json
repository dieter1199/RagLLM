    "cve_description": "curl and libcurl 7.2x before 7.24.0 do not properly consider special characters during extraction of a pathname from a URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct data-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by a CRLF injection attack on the (1) IMAP, (2) POP3, or (3) SMTP protocol.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
    "commit_message": "URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data\n\nProtocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a\ndecoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs\nwith embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value\nless than 32).\n\nURLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and\nallow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and\napplications. Like for example using a URL like\npop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get\na mail and instead this would delete one.\n\nThis flaw is considered a security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036\n\nSecurity advisory at: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html\n\nReported by: Dan Fandrich",
