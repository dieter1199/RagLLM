    "commit_message": "sound/oss: remove offset from load_patch callbacks\n\nWas: [PATCH] sound/oss/midi_synth: prevent underflow, use of\nuninitialized value, and signedness issue\n\nThe offset passed to midi_synth_load_patch() can be essentially\narbitrary.  If it's greater than the header length, this will result in\na copy_from_user(dst, src, negative_val).  While this will just return\n-EFAULT on x86, on other architectures this may cause memory corruption.\nAdditionally, the length field of the sysex_info structure may not be\ninitialized prior to its use.  Finally, a signed comparison may result\nin an unintentionally large loop.\n\nOn suggestion by Takashi Iwai, version two removes the offset argument\nfrom the load_patch callbacks entirely, which also resolves similar\nissues in opl3.  Compile tested only.\n\nv3 adjusts comments and hopefully gets copy offsets right.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dan Rosenberg <drosenberg@vsecurity.com>\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
