    "cwe_description": "The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.",
    "commit_message": "inet: add RCU protection to inet->opt\n\nWe lack proper synchronization to manipulate inet->opt ip_options\n\nProblem is ip_make_skb() calls ip_setup_cork() and\nip_setup_cork() possibly makes a copy of ipc->opt (struct ip_options),\nwithout any protection against another thread manipulating inet->opt.\n\nAnother thread can change inet->opt pointer and free old one under us.\n\nUse RCU to protect inet->opt (changed to inet->inet_opt).\n\nInstead of handling atomic refcounts, just copy ip_options when\nnecessary, to avoid cache line dirtying.\n\nWe cant insert an rcu_head in struct ip_options since its included in\nskb->cb[], so this patch is large because I had to introduce a new\nip_options_rcu structure.\n\nSigned-off-by: Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com>\nCc: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
