    "commit_message": "Fix #13816: Update history when copying issues\n\nUntil now, copying bugs using the \"View Issues\" page creates wrong/\nincomplete history (entries for notes reflect the id's of the original\nissue's notes) and also does not record any trace that the new issue is\nin fact clone of another, which can be a source of confusion.\n\nThis commit prevents the duplication of the original bug's history,\ngenerating instead a single history entry similar to what happens when\ncloning a bug with the Clone button in view.php page.\n\nThe display of history entries for cloned bugs has been slightly\nmodified, the bug id is now printed under the 'Field' column instead of\nthe 'Change' column, like entries for adding notes (as cloning s not a\nchange).",
