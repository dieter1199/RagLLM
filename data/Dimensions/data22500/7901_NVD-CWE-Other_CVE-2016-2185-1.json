If given malicious descriptor that specify one\ninterface or no endpoints, it will crash in the probe function.\nEnsure there is at least two interfaces and one endpoint for each\ninterface before using it.\n\nThe full disclosure: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Mar/90\n\nReported-by: Ralf Spenneberg <ralf@spenneberg.net>\nSigned-off-by: Vladis Dronov <vdronov@redhat.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com>",
