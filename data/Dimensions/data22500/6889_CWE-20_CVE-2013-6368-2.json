This patches concerts those functions to use\nkvm_write_guest_cached and kvm_read_guest_cached.  It also checks the\nvapic_address specified by userspace during ioctl processing and returns\nan error to userspace if the address is not a valid GPA.\n\nThis is generally not guest triggerable, because the required write is\ndone by firmware that runs before the guest.  Also, it only affects AMD\nprocessors and oldish Intel that do not have the FlexPriority feature\n(unless you disable FlexPriority, of course; then newer processors are\nalso affected).\n\nFixes: b93463aa59d6 ('KVM: Accelerated apic support')\n\nReported-by: Andrew Honig <ahonig@google.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Honig <ahonig@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>",
