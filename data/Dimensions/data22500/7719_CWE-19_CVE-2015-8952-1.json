Similarly to ext4 the tricky part is that\nxattr block corresponding to found mbcache entry can get freed before we\nget buffer lock for that block. So we have to check whether the entry is\nstill valid after getting the buffer lock.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>\nSigned-off-by: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>",
