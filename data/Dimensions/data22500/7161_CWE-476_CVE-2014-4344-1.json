This could\nresult in a null dereference.\n\nCVE-2014-4344:\n\nIn MIT krb5 1.5 and newer, an unauthenticated or partially\nauthenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL dereference and\napplication crash during a SPNEGO negotiation by sending an empty\ntoken as the second or later context token from initiator to acceptor.\nThe attacker must provide at least one valid context token in the\nsecurity context negotiation before sending the empty token.  This can\nbe done by an unauthenticated attacker by forcing SPNEGO to\nrenegotiate the underlying mechanism, or by using IAKERB to wrap an\nunauthenticated AS-REQ as the first token.\n\n    CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C\n\n[kaduk@mit.edu: CVE summary, CVSSv2 vector]\n\nticket: 7970 (new)\nsubject: NULL dereference in SPNEGO acceptor for continuation tokens [CVE-2014-4344]\ntarget_version: 1.12.2\ntags: pullup",
