    "cve_description": "The ext4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 does not properly track the initialization of certain data structures, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via a crafted USB device, related to the ext4_fill_super function.",

    "cwe_name": "Other",
    "cwe_description": "NVD is only using a subset of CWE for mapping instead of the entire CWE, and the weakness type is not covered by that subset.",
    "commit_message": "ext4: use ext4_get_block_write in buffer write\n\nAllocate uninitialized extent before ext4 buffer write and\nconvert the extent to initialized after io completes.\nThe purpose is to make sure an extent can only be marked\ninitialized after it has been written with new data so\nwe can safely drop the i_mutex lock in ext4 DIO read without\nexposing stale data. This helps to improve multi-thread DIO\nread performance on high-speed disks.\n\nSkip the nobh and data=journal mount cases to make things simple for now.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jiaying Zhang <jiayingz@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: \"Theodore Ts'o\" <tytso@mit.edu>",
