    "cwe_description": "The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.",
    "commit_message": "regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly regsets\n\nThe regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always\nhave .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods.\nUnfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.\n\nRather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with\nnull .get or .set methods explicitly.\n\nSigned-off-by: H.
