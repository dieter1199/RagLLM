Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file\npermissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in\na similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.\n\nReferences: CVE-2016-7097\nReviewed-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>\nReviewed-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruenba@redhat.com>",
