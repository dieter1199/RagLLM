    "cve_description": "A type confusion vulnerability when resolving properties of JavaScript objects with specially-crafted prototype chains in Facebook Hermes prior to commit fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",

    "cwe_description": "The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.",
    "commit_message": "[CVE-2020-1911] Look up HostObject computed properties on the right object in the prototype chain.\n\nSummary:\nThe change in the hermes repository fixes the security vulnerability\nCVE-2020-1911.  This vulnerability only affects applications which\nallow evaluation of uncontrolled, untrusted JavaScript code not\nshipped with the app, so React Native apps will generally not be affected.\n\nThis revision includes a test for the bug.  The test is generic JSI\ncode, so it is included in the hermes and react-native repositories.\n\nChangelog: [Internal]\n\nReviewed By: tmikov\n\nDifferential Revision: D23322992\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 4e88c974afe1ad33a263f9cac03e9dc98d33649a",
