We\ncurrently indicate success, but do not return a packet in the\ncase where we hit an empty line. The smart protocol was not\nprepared to handle such packets in all cases, though, resulting\nin a `NULL` pointer dereference.\n\nFix the issue by returning an error instead. As such kind of\npackets is not even specified by upstream, this is the right\nthing to do.",
