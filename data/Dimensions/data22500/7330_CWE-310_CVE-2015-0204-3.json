    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-0204",
    "cve_description": "The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL servers to conduct RSA-to-EXPORT_RSA downgrade attacks and facilitate brute-force decryption by offering a weak ephemeral RSA key in a noncompliant role, related to the \"FREAK\" issue.  NOTE: the scope of this CVE is only client code based on OpenSSL, not EXPORT_RSA issues associated with servers or other TLS implementations.",
    "cve_publish_date": "2015-01-09",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-310",
    "cwe_name": "Cryptographic Issues",
    "cwe_description": "Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed.",
    "commit_message": "Only allow ephemeral RSA keys in export ciphersuites.\n\nOpenSSL clients would tolerate temporary RSA keys in non-export\nciphersuites. It also had an option SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA which\nenabled this server side. Remove both options as they are a\nprotocol violation.\n\nThanks to Karthikeyan Bhargavan for reporting this issue.\n(CVE-2015-0204)\nReviewed-by: Matt Caswell <matt@openssl.org>",
