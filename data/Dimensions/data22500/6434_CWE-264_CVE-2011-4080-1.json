    "commit_message": "sysctl: restrict write access to dmesg_restrict\n\nWhen dmesg_restrict is set to 1 CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to read the kernel\nring buffer.  But a root user without CAP_SYS_ADMIN is able to reset\ndmesg_restrict to 0.\n\nThis is an issue when e.g.  LXC (Linux Containers) are used and complete\nuser space is running without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  A unprivileged and jailed\nroot user can bypass the dmesg_restrict protection.\n\nWith this patch writing to dmesg_restrict is only allowed when root has\nCAP_SYS_ADMIN.\n\nSigned-off-by: Richard Weinberger <richard@nod.at>\nAcked-by: Dan Rosenberg <drosenberg@vsecurity.com>\nAcked-by: Serge E.
