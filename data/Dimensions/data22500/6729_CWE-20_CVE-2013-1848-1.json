    "cwe_name": "Improper Input Validation",
    "cwe_description": "The product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.",
    "commit_message": "ext3: Fix format string issues\n\next3_msg() takes the printk prefix as the second parameter and the\nformat string as the third parameter. Two callers of ext3_msg omit the\nprefix and pass the format string as the second parameter and the first\nparameter to the format string as the third parameter. In both cases\nthis string comes from an arbitrary source. Which means the string may\ncontain format string characters, which will\nlead to undefined and potentially harmful behavior.\n\nThe issue was introduced in commit 4cf46b67eb(\"ext3: Unify log messages\nin ext3\") and is fixed by this patch.\n\nCC: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>",
