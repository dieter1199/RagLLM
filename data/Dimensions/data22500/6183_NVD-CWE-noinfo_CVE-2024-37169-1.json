    "cve_description": "@jmondi/url-to-png is a self-hosted URL to PNG utility. Versions prior to 2.0.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary file read if a threat actor uses the Playright's screenshot feature to exploit the file wrapper. Version 2.0.3 mitigates this issue by requiring input URLs to be of protocol `http` or `https`. No known workarounds are available aside from upgrading.",

Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by\nusing the file:// URI scheme to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem,\npotentially exposing sensitive information, such as AWS credentials.\n\nThis commit addresses the vulnerability by implementing proper input validation\nand sanitization to prevent the use of the file:// URI scheme in Playwright\nscreenshot requests, mitigating the risk of unauthorized file access.\n\nresolves #47",
