'''Creates a PortalMember and returns it. The properties argument
can be a mapping with additional member properties. Raises an
exception if the given id already exists, the password does not
comply with the policy in effect, or the authenticated user is not
allowed to grant one of the roles listed (where Member is a special
role that can always be granted); these conditions should be
detected before the fact so that a cleaner message can be printed.
