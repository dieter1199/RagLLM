A sufficiently large value will cause an\ninteger overflow in allocation size, followed by copying too much data\ninto the allocated buffer.  Fix this by restricting nsops to SEMOPM.\nUntested.\n\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Dan Rosenberg <drosenberg@vsecurity.com>\nSigned-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>",
