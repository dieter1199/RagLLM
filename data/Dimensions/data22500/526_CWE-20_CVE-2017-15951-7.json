    "cve_description": "The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.10 does not correctly synchronize the actions of updating versus finding a key in the \"negative\" state to avoid a race condition, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-20",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Input Validation",
    "cwe_description": "The product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.",
    "commit_message": "KEYS: Fix race between updating and finding a negative key\n\nConsolidate KEY_FLAG_INSTANTIATED, KEY_FLAG_NEGATIVE and the rejection\nerror into one field such that:\n\n (1) The instantiation state can be modified/read atomically.\n\n (2) The error can be accessed atomically with the state.\n\n (3) The error isn't stored unioned with the payload pointers.\n\nThis deals with the problem that the state is spread over three different\nobjects (two bits and a separate variable) and reading or updating them\natomically isn't practical, given that not only can uninstantiated keys\nchange into instantiated or rejected keys, but rejected keys can also turn\ninto instantiated keys - and someone accessing the key might not be using\nany locking.\n\nThe main side effect of this problem is that what was held in the payload\nmay change, depending on the state.  For instance, you might observe the\nkey to be in the rejected state.  You then read the cached error, but if\nthe key semaphore wasn't locked, the key might've become instantiated\nbetween the two reads - and you might now have something in hand that isn't\nactually an error code.\n\nThe state is now KEY_IS_UNINSTANTIATED, KEY_IS_POSITIVE or a negative error\ncode if the key is negatively instantiated.  The key_is_instantiated()\nfunction is replaced with key_is_positive() to avoid confusion as negative\nkeys are also 'instantiated'.\n\nAdditionally, barriering is included:\n\n (1) Order payload-set before state-set during instantiation.\n\n (2) Order state-read before payload-read when using the key.\n\nFurther separate barriering is necessary if RCU is being used to access the\npayload content after reading the payload pointers.\n\nFixes: 146aa8b1453b (\"KEYS: Merge the type-specific data with the payload data\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v4.4+\nReported-by: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>\nReviewed-by: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>",
