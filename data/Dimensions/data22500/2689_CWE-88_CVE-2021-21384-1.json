In shescape before version 1.1.3, anyone using _Shescape_ to defend against shell injection may still be vulnerable against shell injection if the attacker manages to insert a into the payload.

Null characters can be used to at\nleast cause errors and potentially execute arbitrary commands (depending\non the shell).\n\nThis bug was found due to the new fuzzing logic.",
