    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-3458",
    "cve_description": "Beaker before 1.6.4, when using PyCrypto to encrypt sessions, uses AES in ECB cipher mode, which might allow remote attackers to obtain portions of sensitive session data via unspecified vectors.",

    "cwe_name": "Cryptographic Issues",
    "cwe_description": "Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed.",
    "commit_message": "Apply patch from Redhat to secure pycrypto that otherwise could allow an attacker to determine contents of the encrypted payload (but is unable to modify).",
