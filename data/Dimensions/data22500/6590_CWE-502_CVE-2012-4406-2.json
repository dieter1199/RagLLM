    "commit_message": "Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON\n\nWe don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is\nsafer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some\nspecific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,\nthough.\n\nTo avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache\npoisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a\nmemcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following\nvalues:\n\n 0 = older, insecure pickle serialization\n 1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)\n 2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)\n\nTo avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should\nupgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24\nhours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in\nfuture versions.\n\nPart of bug 1006414.\n\nChange-Id: Id7d6d547b103b4f23ebf5be98b88f09ec6027ce4",
