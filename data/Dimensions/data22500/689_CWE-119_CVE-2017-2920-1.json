    "cve_description": "An memory corruption vulnerability exists in the .SVG parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.02. A specially crafted .SVG file can cause a vulnerability resulting in memory corruption, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can send a specific .SVG file to trigger this vulnerability.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "Fix a buffer overflow.\n\nThis is only the minimum workaround to prevent buffer overflow:\nStop iterating once the (fixed!) size of the output buffers is\nreached. In response to\nhttps://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0317\n\nHowever, this code is a huge mess anyway and is in no way\nanything like up-to-date C++ code. Please, anyone, replace it\nwith something more modern. Thanks.",
