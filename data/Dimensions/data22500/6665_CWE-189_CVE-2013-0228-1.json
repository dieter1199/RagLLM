The two that are guaranteed are the\n%cs and %ss as they are always fixed GDT selectors. Also they are\ninaccessible from user mode - so they cannot be altered. This is\nthe approach taken in this patch.\n\nAnother alternative option suggested by Jan would be to relay on\nthe subtle realization that using the %ebp or %esp relative references uses\nthe %ss segment.  In which case we could switch from using %eax to %ebp and\nwould not need the %ss over-rides. That would also require one extra\ninstruction to compensate for the one place where the register is used\nas scaled index. However Andrew pointed out that is too subtle and if\nfurther work was to be done in this code-path it could escape folks attention\nand lead to accidents.\n\nReviewed-by: Petr Matousek <pmatouse@redhat.com>\nReported-by: Petr Matousek <pmatouse@redhat.com>\nReviewed-by: Andrew Cooper <andrew.cooper3@citrix.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\nSigned-off-by: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>",
