    "cve_description": "bug_actiongroup.php in MantisBT before 1.2.9 does not properly check the report_bug_threshold permission of the receiving project when moving a bug report, which allows remote authenticated users with the report_bug_threshold and move_bug_threshold privileges for a project to bypass intended access restrictions and move bug reports to a different project.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-264",
    "cwe_name": "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls",
    "cwe_description": "Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control.",
    "commit_message": "Fix Move bugs from projects with access < report_bug_threshold\n\nThe access check in bug_actiongroup.php was not correct. It should\nverify the user's report_bug_threshold in the target project, not the\ncurrent project.\n\nFixes #13748",
