    "commit_message": "mm: memcg: Correct unregistring of events attached to the same eventfd\n\nThere is an issue when memcg unregisters events that were attached to\nthe same eventfd:\n\n- On the first call mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() removes all\n  events attached to a given eventfd, and if there were no events left,\n  thresholds->primary would become NULL;\n\n- Since there were several events registered, cgroups core will call\n  mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() again, but now kernel will oops,\n  as the function doesn't expect that threshold->primary may be NULL.\n\nThat's a good question whether mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event()\nshould actually remove all events in one go, but nowadays it can't\ndo any better as cftype->unregister_event callback doesn't pass\nany private event-associated cookie. So, let's fix the issue by\nsimply checking for threshold->primary.\n\nFWIW, w/o the patch the following oops may be observed:\n\n BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000004\n IP: [<ffffffff810be32c>] mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event+0x9c/0x1f0\n Pid: 574, comm: kworker/0:2 Not tainted 3.3.0-rc4+ #9 Bochs Bochs\n RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff810be32c>]  [<ffffffff810be32c>] mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event+0x9c/0x1f0\n RSP: 0018:ffff88001d0b9d60  EFLAGS: 00010246\n Process kworker/0:2 (pid: 574, threadinfo ffff88001d0b8000, task ffff88001de91cc0)\n Call Trace:\n  [<ffffffff8107092b>] cgroup_event_remove+0x2b/0x60\n  [<ffffffff8103db94>] process_one_work+0x174/0x450\n  [<ffffffff8103e413>] worker_thread+0x123/0x2d0\n\nCc: stable <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Anton Vorontsov <anton.vorontsov@linaro.org>\nAcked-by: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>\nCc: Kirill A.
