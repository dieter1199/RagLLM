    "cve_description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in actionscript/Jplayer.as in the Flash SWF component (jplayer.swf) in jPlayer before 2.2.23 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) jQuery or (2) id parameters, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-1942 and CVE-2013-2023, as demonstrated by using the alert function in the jQuery parameter.  NOTE: these are the same parameters as CVE-2013-1942, but the fix for CVE-2013-1942 uses a blacklist for the jQuery parameter.",
