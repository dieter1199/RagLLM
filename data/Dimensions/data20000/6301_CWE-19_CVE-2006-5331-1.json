    "cve_description": "The altivec_unavailable_exception function in arch/powerpc/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.19 on 64-bit systems mishandles the case where CONFIG_ALTIVEC is defined and the CPU actually supports Altivec, but the Altivec support was not detected by the kernel, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering execution of an Altivec instruction.",

    "commit_message": "[POWERPC] Never panic when taking altivec exceptions from userspace\n\nAt the moment we rely on a cpu feature bit or a firmware property to\ndetect altivec. If we dont have either of these and the cpu does in fact\nsupport altivec we can cause a panic from userspace.\n\nIt seems safer to always send a signal if we manage to get an 0xf20\nexception from userspace.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>\nSigned-off-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>",
