    "cve_description": "The rpza_decode_stream function in libavcodec/rpza.c in FFmpeg before 2.1 does not properly maintain a pointer to pixel data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Apple RPZA data.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
