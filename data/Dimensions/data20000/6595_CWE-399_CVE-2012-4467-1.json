Incorrectly resuling in a failed system call for 32-bit\nprocesses with a 64-bit kernel.\n\nOn odder architectures like HP-PA (with separate user/kernel address\nspaces), it can be used read kernel memory.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
