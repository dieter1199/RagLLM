    "cve_description": "Dragonfly is a Java runtime dependency management library. Dragonfly v0.3.0-SNAPSHOT does not configure DocumentBuilderFactory to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This issue is patched in 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT. As a workaround, since Dragonfly only parses XML `SNAPSHOT` versions are being resolved, this vulnerability may be avoided by not trying to resolve `SNAPSHOT` versions.",
