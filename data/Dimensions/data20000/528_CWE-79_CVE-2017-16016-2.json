    "cve_description": "Sanitize-html is a library for scrubbing html input of malicious values. Versions 1.11.1 and below are vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS) in certain scenarios: If allowed at least one nonTextTags, the result is a potential XSS vulnerability.",

    "cwe_description": "The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",
    "commit_message": "Fixed XSS attack vector via `textarea` tags (when explicitly allowed). Decided that `script` (obviously) and `style` (due to its own XSS vectors) cannot realistically be afforded any XSS protection if allowed, unless we add a full CSS parser. Thanks again to Andrew Krasichkov.",
