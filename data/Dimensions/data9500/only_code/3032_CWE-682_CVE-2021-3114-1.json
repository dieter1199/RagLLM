// On exit, in[i] < 2**28
// We may just have made out[i] negative. So we carry down. If we made
//      and top is zero.
//      The first value of top was in [0..16), therefore, prior to eliminating
//      the first top, 0xfff1000 <= out[3] <= 0xfffffff. Therefore, after
//      overflowing and being reduced by the second carry chain, out[3] <=
//      0xf000. Thus it cannot have overflowed when we eliminated top for the
//      second time.
// Everything depends on the value of out[3].
//    If it's > 0xffff000 and top4AllOnes != 0 then the whole value is >= p
//    If it's = 0xffff000 and top4AllOnes != 0 and bottom3NonZero != 0,
//      then the whole value is >= p
n := out[3] - 0xffff000
// If out[3] > 0xffff000 then n's MSB will be zero.
