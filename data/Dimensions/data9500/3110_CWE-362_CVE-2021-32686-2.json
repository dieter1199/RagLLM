    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32686",
    "cve_description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.",

    "cwe_name": "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')",
    "cwe_description": "The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.",
    "commit_message": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cv8x-p47p-99wr\n\n* - Avoid SSL socket parent/listener getting destroyed during handshake by increasing parent's reference count.\n- Add missing SSL socket close when the newly accepted SSL socket is discarded in SIP TLS transport.\n\n* - Fix silly mistake: accepted active socket created without group lock in SSL socket.\n- Replace assertion with normal validation check of SSL socket instance in OpenSSL verification callback (verify_cb()) to avoid crash, e.g: if somehow race condition with SSL socket destroy happens or OpenSSL application data index somehow gets corrupted.",
