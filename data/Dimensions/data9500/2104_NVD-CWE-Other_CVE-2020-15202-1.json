    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-15202",
    "cve_description": "In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the `Shard` API in TensorFlow expects the last argument to be a function taking two `int64` (i.e., `long long`) arguments. However, there are several places in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or `int32` arguments is being used. In these cases, if the amount of work to be parallelized is large enough, integer truncation occurs. Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are used, this can result in segfaults, read/write outside of heap allocated arrays, stack overflows, or data corruption. The issue is patched in commits 27b417360cbd671ef55915e4bb6bb06af8b8a832 and ca8c013b5e97b1373b3bb1c97ea655e69f31a575, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",

    "commit_message": "Prevent `int64` to `int` truncation in `Shard` API usage.\n\nThe function argument in `Shard` must be a function of two `int64` arguments. However, we are passing in a function with two `int` arguments. Thus, for large workloads, these arguments get truncated from positive `int64` values to negative `int` ones, resulting in a buffer out of bounds write.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 332557334\nChange-Id: I236c9a2e7f53580e520571da8ba941a3aa9fa0b5",
