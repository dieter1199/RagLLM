    "cve_description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c does not validate the sect and head fields, as demonstrated by an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user when a floppy disk has been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.",

    "cwe_description": "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.",
    "commit_message": "floppy: fix out-of-bounds read in copy_buffer\n\nThis fixes a global out-of-bounds read access in the copy_buffer\nfunction of the floppy driver.\n\nThe FDDEFPRM ioctl allows one to set the geometry of a disk.  The sect\nand head fields (unsigned int) of the floppy_drive structure are used to\ncompute the max_sector (int) in the make_raw_rw_request function.  It is\npossible to overflow the max_sector.  Next, max_sector is passed to the\ncopy_buffer function and used in one of the memcpy calls.\n\nAn unprivileged user could trigger the bug if the device is accessible,\nbut requires a floppy disk to be inserted.\n\nThe patch adds the check for the .sect * .head multiplication for not\noverflowing in the set_geometry function.\n\nThe bug was found by syzkaller.\n\nSigned-off-by: Denis Efremov <efremov@ispras.ru>\nTested-by: Willy Tarreau <w@1wt.eu>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
