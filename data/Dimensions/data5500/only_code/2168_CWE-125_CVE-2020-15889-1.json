** Does a young collection. First, mark 'OLD1' objects.  (Only survival
** and "recent old" lists can contain 'OLD1' objects. New lists cannot
** contain 'OLD1' objects, at most 'OLD0' objects that were already
** visited when marked old.) Then does the atomic step. Then,
** sweep all lists and advance pointers. Finally, finish the collection.
