    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32662",
    "cve_description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and techdocs-common contains common functionalities for Backstage's TechDocs. In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.",

    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
    "commit_message": "Add validation to prevent docs_dir from being an absolute path\n\n* Adds a new validation function to helpers to prevent generation when mkdocs.yml is not present or is invalid\n* Handles vulnerability where docs_dir can be put in as an absolute path which copies and exposes the files from that absolute path in the file system\n\nSigned-off-by: Jussi Hallila <jussi@hallila.com>",
