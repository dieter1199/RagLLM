    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-39196",
    "cve_description": "pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected versions this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate permissions. This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem. There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.",

    "cwe_description": "The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.",
    "commit_message": "Fixed major security bug.\n\nA user could effectively specify an undefined url and the program would return a null filter rather than throwing an exception and returning an error to the user. This was a really bad bug. I found it when I was adding code to validate the path parameters. That will be coming in the next commit.",
