    "cwe_name": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "Fix/improve buffer overflow in MSG_ReadBits/MSG_WriteBits\n\nPrevent reading past end of message in MSG_ReadBits. If read past\nend of msg->data buffer (16348 bytes) the engine could SEGFAULT.\nMake MSG_WriteBits use an exact buffer overflow check instead of\npossibly failing with a few bytes left.",
