    "cve_description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the FAQ package 2.x before 2.3.6, 4.x before 4.0.5, and 5.x before 5.0.5 in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via crafted search parameters.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
