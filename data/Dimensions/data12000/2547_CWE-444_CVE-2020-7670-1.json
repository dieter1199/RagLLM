    "cve_description": "agoo prior to 2.14.0 allows request smuggling attacks where agoo is used as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing. It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks where `agoo` is used as part of a chain of backend servers due to insufficient `Content-Length` and `Transfer Encoding` parsing.",
