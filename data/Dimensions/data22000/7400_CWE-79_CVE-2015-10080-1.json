    "commit_message": "Fix XSS escaping issues in the admin data tables.\n\nI mistakenly thought DataTables escaped things by default, but this is\nnot the case. Escape all data tables fields now and add capybara\nintegrations tests to ensure this is effective.\n\nSetting up the Capybara tests required a slight change in the analytics\n\"Filter Logs\" table, since the ajax request needs to be performed via\nPOST instead of GET. I think this is due to the length of the URL\ninvolved in the query. This had worked in most browsers, but I'm\nguessing this was broken in IE anyway, so it's probably a good idea\nanyway.",
