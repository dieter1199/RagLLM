    "cve_description": "The do_double_fault function in arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17.4 does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a modify_ldt system call, as demonstrated by sigreturn_32 in the linux-clock-tests test suite.",

    "cwe_id": "CWE-17",
    "cwe_name": "DEPRECATED: Code",
    "cwe_description": "This entry has been deprecated.  It was originally used for organizing the Development View (CWE-699) and some other views, but it introduced unnecessary complexity and depth to the resulting tree.",
    "commit_message": "x86_64, traps: Stop using IST for #SS\n\nOn a 32-bit kernel, this has no effect, since there are no IST stacks.\n\nOn a 64-bit kernel, #SS can only happen in user code, on a failed iret\nto user space, a canonical violation on access via RSP or RBP, or a\ngenuine stack segment violation in 32-bit kernel code.  The first two\ncases don't need IST, and the latter two cases are unlikely fatal bugs,\nand promoting them to double faults would be fine.\n\nThis fixes a bug in which the espfix64 code mishandles a stack segment\nviolation.\n\nThis saves 4k of memory per CPU and a tiny bit of code.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy Lutomirski <luto@amacapital.net>\nReviewed-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
