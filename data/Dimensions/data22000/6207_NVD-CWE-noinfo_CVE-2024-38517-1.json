    "cve_description": "Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer underflow in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing JSON text from a stream. An attacker needs to send the victim a crafted file which needs to be opened; this triggers the integer underflow vulnerability (when the file is parsed), leading to elevation of privilege.",

    "commit_message": "Prevent int underflow when parsing exponents\n\nWhen parsing negative exponents, the current implementation takes\nprecautions for |exp| to not underflow int.\n\nBut that is not sufficient: later on [1], |exp + expFrac| is also\nstored to an int - so we must ensure that the sum stays within int\nrepresentable values.\n\nUpdate the exp clamping logic to take expFrac into account.\n\n[1] https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/blob/master/include/rapidjson/reader.h#L1690",
