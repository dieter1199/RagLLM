    "commit_message": "fs,userns: Change inode_capable to capable_wrt_inode_uidgid\n\nThe kernel has no concept of capabilities with respect to inodes; inodes\nexist independently of namespaces.  For example, inode_capable(inode,\nCAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE) would be nonsense.\n\nThis patch changes inode_capable to check for uid and gid mappings and\nrenames it to capable_wrt_inode_uidgid, which should make it more\nobvious what it does.\n\nFixes CVE-2014-4014.\n\nCc: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>\nCc: Serge Hallyn <serge.hallyn@ubuntu.com>\nCc: \"Eric W.
