    "commit_message": "chsh, chfn, vipw: fix filenames collision\n\nThe utils when compiled WITHOUT libuser then mkostemp()ing\n\"/etc/%s.XXXXXX\" where the filename prefix is argv[0] basename.\n\nAn attacker could repeatedly execute the util with modified argv[0]\nand after many many attempts mkostemp() may generate suffix which\nmakes sense. The result maybe temporary file with name like rc.status\nld.so.preload or krb5.keytab, etc.\n\nNote that distros usually use libuser based ch{sh,fn} or stuff from\nshadow-utils.\n\nIt's probably very minor security bug.\n\nAddresses: CVE-2015-5224\nSigned-off-by: Karel Zak <kzak@redhat.com>",
