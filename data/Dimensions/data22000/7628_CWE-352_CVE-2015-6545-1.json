We don't have any evidence of this having taken place in the wild, but we were able to reproduce the results with the proof-of-concept in the advisory. A logged in worker could be tricked into visiting a URL that could perform certain actions in their browser session. Cerb now uses the Synchronizer pattern: a session-based token included with every HTML FORM and Ajax request that is compared to the active session. This verifies that such requests are coming from an existing Cerb page rather than an external source. When a potential CSRF attack is detected, the event is now logged in the PHP log as a warning.",
