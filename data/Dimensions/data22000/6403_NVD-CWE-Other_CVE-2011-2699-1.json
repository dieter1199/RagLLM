    "cve_description": "The IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.1 does not generate Fragment Identification values separately for each destination, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disrupted networking) by predicting these values and sending crafted packets.",

    "commit_message": "ipv6: make fragment identifications less predictable\n\nIPv6 fragment identification generation is way beyond what we use for\nIPv4 : It uses a single generator. Its not scalable and allows DOS\nattacks.\n\nNow inetpeer is IPv6 aware, we can use it to provide a more secure and\nscalable frag ident generator (per destination, instead of system wide)\n\nThis patch :\n1) defines a new secure_ipv6_id() helper\n2) extends inet_getid() to provide 32bit results\n3) extends ipv6_select_ident() with a new dest parameter\n\nReported-by: Fernando Gont <fernando@gont.com.ar>\nSigned-off-by: Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
