    "cve_description": "The mbcache feature in the ext2 and ext4 filesystem implementations in the Linux kernel before 4.6 mishandles xattr block caching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) via filesystem operations in environments that use many attributes, as demonstrated by Ceph and Samba.",

The only tricky part is\nthat xattr block corresponding to found mbcache entry can get freed\nbefore we get buffer lock for that block. So we have to check whether\nthe entry is still valid after getting buffer lock.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>\nSigned-off-by: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>",
