    "cve_description": "Discourse is an open-source messaging platform. In versions 3.0.1 and prior on the `stable` branch and versions 3.1.0.beta2 and prior on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of personal messages displayed for a tag is a count of all personal messages regardless of whether the personal message is visible to a given user. As a result, any users can technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new personal message is created even if the user does not have access to the personal message.\n\nIn the patched versions, the count of personal messages tagged with a given tag is hidden by default. To revert to the old behaviour of displaying the count of personal messages for a given tag, an admin may enable the `display_personal_messages_tag_counts` site setting.",

    "commit_message": "SECURITY: Hide PM count for tags by default (#20061)\n\nCurrently `Topic#pm_topic_count` is a count of all personal messages tagged for a given tag. As a result, any user with access to PM tags can poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new personal message has been created using that tag even if the user does not have access to the personal message. We classify this as a minor leak in sensitive information.\r\n\r\nWith this commit, `Topic#pm_topic_count` is hidden from users by default unless the `display_personal_messages_tag_counts` site setting is enabled.",
