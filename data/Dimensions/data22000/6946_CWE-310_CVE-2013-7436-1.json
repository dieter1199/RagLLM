    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-7436",
    "cve_description": "noVNC before 0.5 does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session.",

    "cwe_name": "Cryptographic Issues",
    "cwe_description": "Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed.",
    "commit_message": "Adds support for secure attribute on token cookie\n\nThis patch adds support for the secure attribute on token\ncookies (sent by nova-novncproxy). If the https is used\nto transfer the cookie, the secure attribute is set thus\nrestricting server requestes to secure conections only.\nThis should prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.",
