    "commit_message": "mm: avoid wrapping vm_pgoff in mremap()\n\nThe normal mmap paths all avoid creating a mapping where the pgoff\ninside the mapping could wrap around due to overflow.  However, an\nexpanding mremap() can take such a non-wrapping mapping and make it\nbigger and cause a wrapping condition.\n\nNoticed by Robert Swiecki when running a system call fuzzer, where it\ncaused a BUG_ON() due to terminally confusing the vma_prio_tree code.  A\nvma dumping patch by Hugh then pinpointed the crazy wrapped case.\n\nReported-and-tested-by: Robert Swiecki <robert@swiecki.net>\nAcked-by: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
