    "cve_description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Sefrengo before 1.6.2 allow (1) remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sefrengo cookie in a login to backend/main.php or (2) remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the value_id parameter in a save_value action to backend/main.php.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
