This matches what snprintf() and strlcpy() do, for the\nbenefit of routines constructing a string in a fixed-length buffer with\nmultiple calls, one of which is format_fractional_part_nsecs().\n\nHave format_fractional_part_nsecs() check for a count of nanoseconds\ngreatre than or equal to 1 billion, and report that specially.\n\nFix places wher it used the bufer pointer and size of the buffer, rather\nthan the current position in the buffer and the remaining space in the\nbuffer, to append to the buffer and make sure doing so doesn't overrun\nthe buffer.\n\nRename some variable names (rename buf_remaining to just remaining,\nrename num_chars to num_bytes as it counts bytes).\n\nFix some comments.",
