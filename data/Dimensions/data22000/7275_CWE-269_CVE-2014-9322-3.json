    "cve_description": "arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 3.17.5 does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an IRET instruction that leads to access to a GS Base address from the wrong space.",

    "cwe_name": "Improper Privilege Management",
    "cwe_description": "The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.",
    "commit_message": "x86_64, traps: Stop using IST for #SS\n\nOn a 32-bit kernel, this has no effect, since there are no IST stacks.\n\nOn a 64-bit kernel, #SS can only happen in user code, on a failed iret\nto user space, a canonical violation on access via RSP or RBP, or a\ngenuine stack segment violation in 32-bit kernel code.  The first two\ncases don't need IST, and the latter two cases are unlikely fatal bugs,\nand promoting them to double faults would be fine.\n\nThis fixes a bug in which the espfix64 code mishandles a stack segment\nviolation.\n\nThis saves 4k of memory per CPU and a tiny bit of code.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy Lutomirski <luto@amacapital.net>\nReviewed-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
