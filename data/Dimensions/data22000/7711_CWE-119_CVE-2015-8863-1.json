    "cve_description": "Off-by-one error in the tokenadd function in jv_parse.c in jq allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long JSON-encoded number, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
    "commit_message": "Heap buffer overflow in tokenadd() (fix #105)\n\nThis was an off-by one: the NUL terminator byte was not allocated on\nresize.  This was triggered by JSON-encoded numbers longer than 256\nbytes.",
