    "cve_description": "fs/proc/root.c in the procfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2 does not properly interact with CLONE_NEWPID clone system calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reference leak and memory consumption) by making many connections to a daemon that uses PID namespaces to isolate clients, as demonstrated by vsftpd.",

    "cwe_description": "The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.",
