    "cve_description": "foreman before version 1.15.0 is vulnerable to an information leak through organizations and locations feature. When a user is assigned _no_ organizations/locations, they are able to view all resources instead of none (mirroring an administrator's view). The user's actions are still limited by their assigned permissions, e.g. to control viewing, editing and deletion.",

    "commit_message": "Fixes #16982 - Scope properly when no taxonomies are set\n\nThe default scope for hosts and other objects did not restrict\nproperly by taxonomies. An user without organizations or\nlocations, could do anything it's permissions allow to.\nThe list of hosts was unrestricted and showed hosts in\nany location or organization.\n\nThis is fixed to work so that:\n\nUsers without taxonomies, when set to 'any context' cannot see\nanything (at all)\n\nUsers with taxonomies, when set to 'any context' can see\neverything within all of their taxonomies context (including\nchildren taxonomies).\n\nAdmins set to 'any context' can see everything - regardless\nof whether it has a taxonomy or not.\n\nUsers or admins set to some organization/location scope\ncan only see stuff within scope.",
