    "cve_description": "SwiftTerm is a Xterm/VT100 Terminal emulator. Prior to commit a94e6b24d24ce9680ad79884992e1dff8e150a31, an attacker could modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Version a94e6b24d24ce9680ad79884992e1dff8e150a31 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds available.",

    "commit_message": "Fix two possible attack vectors, where an attacker can store\ninformation into the termianl and then get to replay it.\n\nTwo of those instances are setting the terminal title, and icon title,\nand then requesting the values back (see CVE-2003-0063[2] and\nhttps://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104612710031920&w=2 for details).\n\nAnd another case is sending an invalid DECRQSS sequence, which the\nhandler would respond back with the results, see here for how this is\nused: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510030 CVE-2008-2383[3]\n\nThese bugs were found and disclosed by David Leadbeater <dgl@dgl.cx>\n(@dgl at Github.com)",
