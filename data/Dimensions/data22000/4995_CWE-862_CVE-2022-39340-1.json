    "cve_description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Prior to version 0.2.4, the `streamed-list-objects` endpoint was not validating the authorization header, resulting in disclosure of objects in the store. Users `openfga/openfga` versions 0.2.3 and prior who are exposing the OpenFGA service to the internet are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.",
