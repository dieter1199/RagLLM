    "commit_message": "pids: fix fork_idle() to setup ->pids correctly\n\ncopy_process(pid => &init_struct_pid) doesn't do attach_pid/etc.\n\nIt shouldn't, but this means that the idle threads run with the wrong\npids copied from the caller's task_struct. In x86 case the caller is\neither kernel_init() thread or keventd.\n\nIn particular, this means that after the series of cpu_up/cpu_down an\nidle thread (which never exits) can run with .pid pointing to nowhere.\n\nChange fork_idle() to initialize idle->pids[] correctly. We only set\n.pid = &init_struct_pid but do not add .node to list, INIT_TASK() does\nthe same for the boot-cpu idle thread (swapper).\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>\nCc: Cedric Le Goater <clg@fr.ibm.com>\nCc: Dave Hansen <haveblue@us.ibm.com>\nCc: Eric Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>\nCc: Herbert Poetzl <herbert@13thfloor.at>\nCc: Mathias Krause <Mathias.Krause@secunet.com>\nAcked-by: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>\nAcked-by: Serge Hallyn <serue@us.ibm.com>\nCc: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@us.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
