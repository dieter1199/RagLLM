    "cve_description": "The filesystem layer in the Linux kernel before 4.5.5 proceeds with post-rename operations after an OverlayFS file is renamed to a self-hardlink, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a rename system call, related to fs/namei.c and fs/open.c.",

    "cwe_description": "The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.",
    "commit_message": "vfs: rename: check backing inode being equal\n\nIf a file is renamed to a hardlink of itself POSIX specifies that rename(2)\nshould do nothing and return success.\n\nThis condition is checked in vfs_rename().  However it won't detect hard\nlinks on overlayfs where these are given separate inodes on the overlayfs\nlayer.\n\nOverlayfs itself detects this condition and returns success without doing\nanything, but then vfs_rename() will proceed as if this was a successful\nrename (detach_mounts(), d_move()).\n\nThe correct thing to do is to detect this condition before even calling\ninto overlayfs.  This patch does this by calling vfs_select_inode() to get\nthe underlying inodes.\n\nSigned-off-by: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@redhat.com>\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v4.2+",
