    "cve_description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.11. The ipddp_ioctl function in drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.c allows local users to obtain sensitive kernel address information by leveraging CAP_NET_ADMIN to read the ipddp_route dev and next fields via an SIOCFINDIPDDPRT ioctl call.",

    "cwe_description": "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.",
    "commit_message": "net/appletalk: fix minor pointer leak to userspace in SIOCFINDIPDDPRT\n\nFields ->dev and ->next of struct ipddp_route may be copied to\nuserspace on the SIOCFINDIPDDPRT ioctl. This is only accessible\nto CAP_NET_ADMIN though. Let's manually copy the relevant fields\ninstead of using memcpy().\n\nBugLink: http://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2018/09/linux-kernel-infoleaks.html\nCc: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Willy Tarreau <w@1wt.eu>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
