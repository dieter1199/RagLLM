    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "cwe_name": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
    "cwe_description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
    "commit_message": "Fixed SQL injection issue in _Load_Users\n\nThat was probably the only place in the software that had SQL injection since\nwe took the sort value and put it directly into the query.  The sort value\nis now verified as a valid column.\n\nThis wasn't really an issue however since the JSON entrypoint was only accessible\nvia an admin account anyway.",
