    "commit_message": "Protect against 8.3 \"short name\" attacks also on Linux/macOS\n\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is getting increasingly popular,\nin particular because it makes it _so_ easy to run Linux software on\nWindows' files, via the auto-mounted Windows drives (`C:\\` is mapped to\n`/mnt/c/`, no need to set that up manually).\n\nUnfortunately, files/directories on the Windows drives can be accessed\nvia their _short names_, if that feature is enabled (which it is on the\n`C:` drive by default).\n\nWhich means that we have to safeguard even our Linux users against the\nshort name attacks.\n\nFurther, while the default options of CIFS/SMB-mounts seem to disallow\naccessing files on network shares via their short names on Linux/macOS,\nit _is_ possible to do so with the right options.\n\nSo let's just safe-guard against short name attacks _everywhere_.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>",
