    "commit_message": "fix: CCE user cannot update artifact sometimes\n\nHow to reproduce:\nHave an artifact A with a comment containing a cross reference to another\nartifact B like `See art #123`.\nIn the tracker of the artifact A, upload a Custom Code Execution module\nin the administration.\n\nThere is an example module if you need one:\n```\ncd plugins/tracker_cce/wasm_modules/post-action-add-comment\nnix-shell\ncargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release\n```\nThen you can upload the generated file:\n`plugins/tracker_cce/wasm_modules/post-action-add-comment/target/wasm32-wasi/release/post-action-add-comment.wasm`\n\nThe example module take an integer field `field_a`, an integer field\n`field_b`, and fill a text field `field_sum`. You will need them for the\ntest. Or use your own module.\n\nNow update the artifact A. The (async) execution of the module should be a\nsuccess and a new comment is added to the artifact by CCE user.\n\nCloses request #35862: Artifact userCanView not properly cached\nPart of story #35093: execute custom code as artifact post action\n\nChange-Id: Id08ce6570c1dd2c7ebedcd70339f9d9d6b008d58",
