    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31995",
    "cve_description": "`@digitalbazaar/zcap` provides JavaScript reference implementation for Authorization Capabilities. Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time.",
