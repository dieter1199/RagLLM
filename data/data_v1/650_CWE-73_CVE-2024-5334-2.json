    "cve_description": "A local file read vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the 'snapshot_path' parameter in the '/api/get-browser-snapshot' endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a request with a malicious 'snapshot_path' parameter, leading to arbitrary file read from the system. This issue impacts the security of the application by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.",
