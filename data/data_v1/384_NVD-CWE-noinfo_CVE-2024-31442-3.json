    "cve_description": "Redon Hub is a Roblox Product Delivery Bot, also known as a Hub. In all hubs before version 1.0.2, all commands are capable of being ran by all users, including admin commands. This allows users to receive products for free and delete/create/update products/tags/etc. The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for bot owners only. All users should upgrade to version 1.0.2 to receive a patch.",
