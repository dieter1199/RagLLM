    "cve_description": "Astro-Shield is a library to compute the subresource integrity hashes for your JS scripts and CSS stylesheets. When automated CSP headers generation for SSR content is enabled and the web application serves content that can be partially controlled by external users, then it is possible that the CSP headers generation feature might be \"allow-listing\" malicious injected resources like inlined JS, or references to external malicious scripts. The fix is available in version 1.3.0.",
