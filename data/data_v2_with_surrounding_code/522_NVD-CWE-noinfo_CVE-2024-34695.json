    "commit_message": "feat(api): Add UserAtomicLock attribute and middleware\n\nThis commit adds the `UserAtomicLock` attribute and middleware to the API. The `UserAtomicLock` attribute is used to lock concurrency on a given action to a specific user. The `UserAtomicLockMiddleware` provides the functionality to lock a given action to a specific user. This ensures that only one request from the same user can access the locked action at a time, preventing unwanted concurrent modifications.",
