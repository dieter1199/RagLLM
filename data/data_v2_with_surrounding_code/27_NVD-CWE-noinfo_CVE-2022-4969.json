    "cve_description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in bwoodsend rockhopper up to 0.1.2. Affected by this issue is the function count_rows of the file rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c of the component Binary Parser. The manipulation of the argument raw leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. Upgrading to version 0.2.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 1a15fad5e06ae693eb9b8908363d2c8ef455104e. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-266312.",

    "commit_message": "Fix a potential security exploit in RaggedArray.loads(buffer, ldtype=np.uint64).\n\nWhen parsing binary data with ldtype=np.uint64, if a length is sufficiently\nclose to 2^64 that it causes the parsing buffer pointer (starting from &buffer)\nto overflow, then arbitrary memory owned by the current process and whose\naddress is < &buffer can be read. Should the overflow map the pointer to a\nlocation not owned by the current process, a segfault will occur.\n\nOverflow is now caught and raised as a ValueError() (like in any other case\nwhere the parsing fails).",
