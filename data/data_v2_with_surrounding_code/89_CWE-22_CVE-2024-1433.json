    "cve_description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in KDE Plasma Workspace up to 5.93.0. This affects the function EventPluginsManager::enabledPlugins of the file components/calendar/eventpluginsmanager.cpp of the component Theme File Handler. The manipulation of the argument pluginId leads to path traversal. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The patch is named 6cdf42916369ebf4ad5bd876c4dfa0170d7b2f01. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-253407. NOTE: This requires write access to user's home or the installation of third party global themes.",

    "cwe_description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
    "commit_message": "plasmacalendarintegration: Fix directory traversal vulnerability in events plugins\n\ndigital-calendar plasma applet is vulnerable to directory traversal attack which allows an arbitrary .so library file to be leaded as a plasma calendar plugin.\n\nThis vulnerability can be triggered via theme files that provide a config for the digital-clock applet which includes `enabledCalendarPlugins` that uses directory traversal to load arbitrary .so from the filesystem.\n\nThis requires write access to user's home or the installation of third party global themes so is not directly exploitable by anything which did not have access already, however it should be fixed regardless.",
