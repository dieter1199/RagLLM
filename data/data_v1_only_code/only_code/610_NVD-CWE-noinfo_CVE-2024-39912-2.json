    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-39912",
    "cve_description": "web-auth/webauthn-lib is an open source set of PHP libraries and a Symfony bundle to allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications. The ProfileBasedRequestOptionsBuilder method returns allowedCredentials without any credentials if no username was found. When WebAuthn is used as the first or only authentication method, an attacker can enumerate usernames based on the absence of the `allowedCredentials` property in the assertion options response. This allows enumeration of valid or invalid usernames. By knowing which usernames are valid, attackers can focus their efforts on a smaller set of potential targets, increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

    "commit_message": "Add feature to hide existing credentials\n\nThe code changes enable suppressing the existing user credential details to enhance security. This feature introduces a preventive measure against username enumeration exploits by concealing the previously existing credentials. The flag 'hide_existing_credentials' has been added to facilitate this change, defaulted to false. This change is particularly important during the attestation ceremony performed by anonymous users.",
