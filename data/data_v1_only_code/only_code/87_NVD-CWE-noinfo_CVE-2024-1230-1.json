    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1230",
    "cve_description": "The SimpleShop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the maybe_disconnect_simpleshop function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the site from simpleshop via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

    "cwe_id": "NVD-CWE-noinfo",
    "commit_message": "Add nonce verification to SimpleShop disconnect feature\n\nThe commit ensures security by adding nonce verification to the option to disconnect SimpleShop. Before this, the \"Disconnect SimpleShop\" link lacked this verification. Now, the option checks the '_wpnonce' query parameter with nonce before proceeding.",
